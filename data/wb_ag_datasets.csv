Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (SPID),"This data entry includes subnational poverty direct estimates from household surveys over time for more than 141 economies at the administrative unit level 1. Administrative unit level 1 refers to the highest subnational unit level (examples include ‘state’, ‘governorate’, ‘province’) from household surveys.<br>In 2013, the World Bank announced the goals of fighting poverty in all its forms by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Despite a remarkable progress made on reducing poverty in recent years, reaching the targets remains challenging. The decline in poverty has been uneven. The poverty reduction in recent years was dominated by the East Asia and Pacific (notably China and Indonesia) and South Asia (notably India) (World Bank, 2017). Despite the progress made so far, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level. In addition, global problems such as climate change, fragility, economic crises and food security pose great risks for poverty reduction, and they are often trans-border issues, which generate strong positive or negative externalities across neighboring countries.",64796,,"[""'name': 'Global Subnational Poverty Shapefile (version 1)'"", ""'description': '<p>This shapefile (version 1) is used to link with the data based on the ID geo_code2.</p>', 'url': null"", ""'name': 'Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (Multidimensional poverty part)'"", ""'description': '<p>This is the Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (SPID) on Multidimensional poverty indicators.</p>', 'url': 'https://datacatalogfiles.worldbank.org/ddh-published/0064796/DR0092190/subnational-poverty-inequality-spid-MPM.xlsx?versionId=2023-09-11T14:24:14.9050463Z'"", ""'name': 'Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (Poverty and Inequality part)'"", ""'description': '<p>This is the Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database"", ""SPID.

 Global Distribution of Economic Activity,"Data for replicating The Global Spatial Distribution of Economic Activity: Nature, History, and the Role of Trade (forthcoming 2018; with Vernon Henderson, Tim Squires and David N. Weil) Quarterly Journal of Economics
We explore the role of natural characteristics in determining the worldwide spatial distribution of economic activity, as proxied by lights at night, observed across 240,000 grid cells. A parsimonious set of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47% of worldwide variation and 35% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers.  We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries.  For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.

Estimates of Distortions to Agricultural Incentives,"The World Bank research project on ""Distortions to Agricultural Incentives"" has produced a core database of Nominal Rates of Assistance to producers, or NRAs, together with a set of Consumer Tax Equivalents, or CTEs, for farm products and a set of Relative Rates of Assistance to farmers in 75 focus countries. The core database provides nominal rates of assistance estimates for the main individual commodities that together account for about 70 percent of the value of farm production in those countries, as well as guesstimates of the NRA for the 30 percent of farm production not covered. Also estimated is the NRA for non-agricultural tradables so as to compute a relative rate of assistance. Consumer tax equivalents are also provided for the covered products in each focus country, along with value of production and consumption at undistorted prices and of trade for each covered product and for non-covered farm products. The supplementary database on trade and welfare reduction indexes provides estimates of welfare and trade reduction indexes for each of the 75 countries.

WPS 8825 - Trading off the Income Gains and the Inequality Costs of Trade Policy,"This paper characterizes the trade-off between the income gains and the inequality costs of trade using survey data for 54 developing countries. Tariff data on agricultural and manufacturing goods are combined with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate the first-order effects of the elimination of import tariffs on household welfare. The paper assesses how these welfare effects vary across the distribution by estimating impacts on the consumption of traded goods, wage income, farm and non-farm family enterprise income, and government transfers. For each country, the income gains and the inequality costs of trade liberalization are quantified and the trade-offs between them are assessed using an Atkinson social welfare index. The analysis finds average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in nine countries. Across countries in the sample, the gains from trade are 1.9 percent of real household expenditure on average. We find overwhelming evidence of a trade-off between the income gains (losses) and the inequality costs (gains), which arise because trade tends to exacerbate income inequality: 45 countries face a trade-off, while only nine do not. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality. In the majority of developing countries, the prevailing tariff structure thus induces sizable welfare losses

Crowdsourced Price Data Collection Pilot,"Crowdsourced price data from 15 pilot countries, namely, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela and Vietnam; from December 2015 to August 2016 and covering 162 household good and service items.
This database is a repository of information collected during a World Bank pilot study on the feasibility of crowdsourced price data collection utilizing modern information and communication technologies. The collected data can be used for a variety of spatial and temporal price studies and other price-related applications.
The data was collected by leveraging a privately-operated network of paid on-the-ground contributors that had access to a smartphone application. Price collection tasks and related guidance was pushed through the application to specific geographical locations. The contributors carried out the requested collection tasks and submitted price data and other metadata using the application.
The pilot was conducted in 15 pilot countries, namely, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela and Vietnam from December 2015 to August 2016. The collected price data covers 162 tightly specified household good and service items, including food and non-alcoholic beverages; alcoholic beverages and tobacco; clothing and footwear; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance; health; transport; communication; recreation and culture; education; restaurants and hotels; and miscellaneous goods and services.
In total, the database includes 1,262,458 price observations, ranging from 196,188 observations for Brazil to 14,102 observations for Cambodia. The observations are accompanied by a rich set of metadata, including longitude and latitude coordinates and related geographical designations, time-stamps, outlet identifiers, volume and weight details, and brand and model information. Due to the pilot nature of this data, the survey coverage varies between and within countries. In addition, the comparability of price data for goods is typically more reliable than those for services.

Global Subnational Poverty Atlas (GSAP),"This data entry includes lined-up subnational poverty estimates (based on international poverty line(s)) in 2019 for more than 168 economies at the administrative unit level 1. Administrative unit level 1 refers to the highest subnational unit level (examples include ‘state’, ‘governorate’, ‘province’) from household surveys.<br>In 2013, the World Bank announced the goals of fighting poverty in all its forms by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Despite a remarkable progress made on reducing poverty in recent years, reaching the targets remains challenging. The decline in poverty has been uneven. The poverty reduction in recent years was dominated by the East Asia and Pacific (notably China and Indonesia) and South Asia (notably India) (World Bank, 2017). Despite the progress made so far, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level. In addition, global problems such as climate change, fragility, economic crises and food security pose great risks for poverty reduction, and they are often trans-border issues, which generate strong positive or negative externalities across neighboring countries.

Indicators of Access to and Use of Financial Services Across Countries,"This project seeks to develop indicators of access to and use of financial services across countries (what we broadly refer to as ""outreach'), as well as to study what explains variations in access, and how such differences affect economic outcomes across countries. For this purpose, we developed two original questionnaires. The first one targets bank regulators in over 100 countries and inquires primarily about the number of bank outlets (branches and ATMs), and the volume and value of loans and deposits in each country. The second questionnaire surveys the 5 largest banks in over 70 countries about the factors that explains their choice of location, the pricing and terms of their products, and who is granted access to them.
At this point, we have completed the collection of data from regulators and have produced a working paper that presents the outreach indicators we developed and analyzes both their determinants and their impact on firm financing constraints. The collection of bank level data is still on-going. So far we have received responses from 169 banks in 71 countries.

Market Access: Kyrgyz Republic,"Exploiting the theory of a classic gravity model, the Market Accessibility index is a measure of potential economic connectivity between village/towns and big cities. These population centers are considered a proxy of market size or population potential. This metric discounts the market size proxy by an estimate<br />
of travel time along a transportation network, which assigns little relevance of a market size in a very far place from the origin or, conversely, assigns a strong relevance for markets in close proximity to the origin. Using the transportation network and estimated travel time is a more realistic measure of<br />
economic distance than Euclidean distance because not all distances are equal in travel time and physical or man-made barriers may provide routes that are not straight line distance. Since various methodologies exist for the discount of the market size, a robustness test is suggested.

Urban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in a Changing Climate - Building Local Resilience to Disaster Risk,"This dataset provides five flood scenarios for Greater Dhaka Area, with estimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation, for extreme rainfall event in 2050.
Intense rainfall floods Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the world’s fastest-growing megacities, year in and year out. Low-lying flood plains, rivers, and canals that once drained water are gradually filling up as a result of indiscriminate urbanization, and now magnify, rather than help solve the problem. The climatic outlook for South Asia in the 21st century signals heavier and more erratic rainfall during the monsoon season, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization.  Thus, climate change may further aggravate Dhaka’s flood vulnerability.
Dhaka needs to better manage its flood drainage infrastructure and strengthen the city’s climate-disaster resilience and adaptive capacity.  But climate-smart policies require local planners to better understand the likely damage from current flooding, potential damage from climate-related risks, measures that can be taken to cope with current and future flooding as well as adaptation costs.
In an effort to enhance such understanding and to provide input to development of adaptation policies, this research estimated location-specific depth and duration of inundation from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change, discussed structural adaptation measures to cope with current and future flooding, evaluated the reduction in inundation resulting from implementing these measures, and estimated adaptation cost.
Depth and duration of inundation in Greater Dhaka Area from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change under different scenarios at ward/ thana-level have been summarized in the Excel Workbook “Urban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in 2050”
<strong>Detailed Study Area:</strong><br />
The dataset covers Greater Dhaka Area: Eastern Dhaka, Western Dhaka-Goranchatbari, Western Dhaka-Kallyanpur, Central Dhaka, Old Dhaka, DND and Narayanganj.
As flooding is a periodic problem in Dhaka, the city can be said to already have an <em>adaptation deficit even without climate change</em>. The analysis therefore addressed the issue from both current and future climate perspectives.
**Future (2050) Rainfall Extreme Scenarios: **
<ul>
<li>
Dhaka experienced 341mm rainfall in 24 hours in September 2004; and this historic extreme rainfall was taken as the current climate baseline in the underlying analysis.
</li>
<li>
For the future, the underlying analysis considered a 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall in a changing climate by 2050.
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Assumptions about the Future:</strong><br />
As any change in land use has implications for the percentage of built-up area, and therefore drainage of the storm water, the analysis assumed that future land cover would change according to the RAJUK’s Detailed Action Plan (DAP). For drainage, the analysis assumed that all improvements to Dhaka’s drainage infrastructure, both planned and proposed by the relevant drainage-system authority, would be implemented.
<strong>Five Alternative Scenarios:</strong><br />
Estimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation were estimated for extreme rainfall event in 2050 for following five scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Scenario1:  341mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
</ul>
As timing and magnitude of climate change is somewhat unknown, ward/thana-level inundation depth and duration for 2050 were generated for the baseline rainfall event without consideration of any climate change. The analysis accounts for expected socioeconomic changes and planned changes in the land use pattern as well as drainage infrastructure.
<ul>
<li>Scenario 2: 341mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>
</ul>
The estimates of inundation from scenario1 were discussed with the local experts and based on their recommendations a set of potential adaptation measures - for example increase in pump capacity, sludge cleaning, laying of new drainage pipes, deepening existing water bodies - was designed and incorporated in hydrological modeling. The modeling was repeated with different capacities of pumps etc. until a desirable depth and duration of inundation for each study region was attained.
<ul>
<li>Scenario 3: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
</ul>
Ward/thana-level estimates of inundation depth and duration were generated for the changing climate in 2050 taking into account climate change - using a potential 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall as a factor as well as accounting for expected socioeconomic changes, planned changes in the land use pattern and drainage infrastructure.
<ul>
<li>Scenario 4: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>
</ul>
Implications for flooding were estimated in a changing climate after current climate adaptation deficit is met.
<ul>
<li>Scenario 5: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit and with adaptation for climate change</li>
</ul>
Implications for a set of adaptation measures suggested by local experts to deal with climate change were estimated.
These estimates are from the three-step hydrological modeling component of the study.  The first modeling step simulated basin-level flows from the Brahmaputra River in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River system since they strongly influence monsoon-season river flows and water levels in the Greater Dhaka area.  In the second step, the effects of climate change on the regional rivers were simulated.  Finally, in the third step, detailed modeling of the drainage system in and around Dhaka city was simulated. The analysis centered on the worst-case scenario in which river levels are high and all sluice gates are closed. Therefore, there is no gravity drainage out of the city and the drainage system depends primarily on the performance efficiency of drainage pumps, which is often the case during intense rainfall.  For Western Dhaka-Old Dhaka, Central Dhaka, Kallyanpur, and Goranchatbari—the impacts of climate change on river flooding were not considered in the analyses as this main part of the city is protected by flood embankments on all sides.

Has Climate Change Driven Urbanization In Africa?,"Replication data for Henderson, J. Vernon, Adam Storeygard, and Uwe Deichmann. ""Has climate change driven urbanization in Africa?."" Journal of Development Economics 124 (2017): 60-82.<br />
Data include climate variables, conflict events, industry by district, urban/rural population, and distance to coast.
This paper documents a substantial impact of climate variation on urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. In a panel of over 350 subnational regions, we find that drier conditions increase urbanization in places most likely to have an urban industrial base. Total city income in such places also increases. When receiving cities have a traded good sector that is not wholly dependent upon local agriculture, migration to cities provides an “escape” from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in most places (75% of our sample) without an industrial base, there is no escape into alternative export-based employment. Drying causes reduced urban and rural incomes, with little overall impact on the urban population share. Finally, the paper shows that climate variation also induces employment changes within the rural sector itself. Drier conditions induce a shift out of farm activities, especially for women, into non-farm activities, and especially out of the measured work force. Overall, these findings imply a strong link between climate and urbanization in Africa.

What Improves Environmental Performance? Evidence from Mexican Industry,"Survey data from Mexico, 1995, which provides detailed information on environmental performance and determinants, including plant, firm and market characteristics, pollution control costs, relationships with regulators, and measures to improve environmental performance. All plant and respondent identities were kept confidential.  The data and survey document are all contained in the zip file.
As preparation for their research paper on ""What Improves Environmental Performance? Evidence from Mexican Industry,"" Susmita Dasgupta, Mala Hettige and David Wheeler used survey evidence to analyze the effects of regulation, plant-level management policies, and plant and firm characteristics on environmental performance in Mexican factories. They focused especially on management policies: the degree of effort to improve environmental performance and the type of management strategy adopted.
The survey, conducted in the fall of 1995, focused on the food, chemicals, non-metallic minerals and metals sectors, which account for 75 percent to 95 percent of Mexico’s total industrial pollution. 236 facilities in the survey were chosen as representative of Mexican factories as defined by sector, size and location.
The survey was designed by a World Bank team, conducted by the Monterrey Institute of Technology, and supported by the Mexico National Environment Ministry (SEMARNAP) and the Mexican National Association of Industries. The survey provides detailed information on performance and determinants, including plant, firm and market characteristics, pollution control costs, relationships with regulators, and measures to improve environmental performance. All plant and respondent identities were kept confidential.
It is important to note the information derived from the survey was self-reported. No independently audited data on pollution and regulatory compliance was associated with the survey.
Finally, with confidentiality assured, 49 percent of survey respondents admitted non-compliance with regulations. With no benchmarks, only educated guesses can be made about the degree of upward bias. Evidence from Indonesia, a country with similar regulations but weaker monitoring and enforcement, revealed a non-compliance rate of 64 percent. This suggests that the degree of upward bias in the Mexican self-assessment may be small. In any case, our analysis for this research focuses on relative, not absolute, performance.

World Integrated Trade Solution UNCTAD TRAINS,"UNCTAD-TRAINS (Trade Analysis and Information System) is a trade and market access information system combining the database containing data drawn from UN TARMAC, a joint primary data collection with the International Trade Centre, UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), and the WITS software. TRAINS is both a data depository and an analytical tool designed for policy-makers and economic operators engaged in international merchandise trade. It is also a powerful tool for multilateral or bilateral trade negotiations as well as for general research on international merchandise trade.
TRAINS contains HS-based data for over 1,000 country/years, covering tariff and non-tariff measures as well as imports flows by origin for more than 160 countries and the years since 1988. For tariffs, TRAINS contains not only general applied tariff data but also information on applied preferential tariff including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and many regional and bilateral preferences.
TRAINS gives users the possibility of converting the HS data into other internationally recognized nomenclatures such as the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) or the Broad Economic Categories (BEC) etc... It also provides a single market, partial equilibrium trade simulation model (SMART model) with which users may simulate trade, revenue and welfare effects of tariff changes by a single market country.
The TRAINS database is physically located at the World Bank server where WITS application is running, but is directly maintained by UNCTAD. Neither UNCTAD, nor the World Bank, accepts the responsibility for the accuracy or suitability of the information provided by in TRAINS database. The user assumes, therefore, all risk associated with the use of the data in TRAINS. The designation employed and the presentation of the material in this database do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, group of countries, territory, city or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.
Access to TRAINS database is free of charge and unlimited. Users need simply to register with WITS and the access is provided automatically.

Quantifying Environmental Performance Survey Results,"For this exercise, we have randomly selected 31 United Nations Conference on Environmental and Development (UNCED) reports from the total of 145. These 31 range from highly industrialized to extremely poor, they are drawn from every world region, and they range in size and diversity from China to Jamaica.
Our survey considers the state of policy and performance in four environmental dimensions: Air, Water, Land and Living Resources. We analyze the apparent state of policy as it affects the interactions between these four environmental dimensions and five activity categories: Agriculture, Industry, Energy, Transport and the Urban Sector. Although many overlaps undoubtedly exist, we attempt to draw a separate assessment for the interaction of each activity category with each environmental dimension.
Our survey assessment uses twenty five questions to categorize the state of (i) environmental awareness; (ii) scope of policies adopted; (iii) scope of legislation enacted; (iv) control mechanisms in place; and (v) the degree of success in implementation. The status in each category is graded ""High, Medium, Low,"" with assigned values of 2, 1 and 0 respectively. For each UNCED country report, all twenty-five questions are answered for each element of the matrix in Table 1. With 20 elements in the matrix, 500 assessment scores are developed for each country.

Overall Trade Restrictiveness Indices and Import Demand Elasticities,"The Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (OTRI) summarizes the trade policy stance of a country by calculating the uniform tariff that will keep its overall imports at the current level when the country in fact has different tariffs for different goods. In a nutshell, the OTRI is a more sophisticated way to calculate the weighted average tariff of a given country, with the weights reflect the composition of import volume and import demand elasticities of each imported product. The empirical methodology of the OTRI was first developed in Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009), based on the theoretical underpinning of Anderson and Neary (1994, 1996, 2003). Irwin (forthcoming) also uses a similar methodology to study the historic protection level of the US, from 1867 to 1961. Recently, Kee, Neagu and Nicita (forthcoming) applied a fixed weight version of OTRI to study protectionism of a wide range of countries during the crisis period.
The OTRI and some other related indices, such as the Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Market Access Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (MAOTRI) are computed annually when new trade flows and tariff data are available. These indices feed into the Global Monitoring Report, an annual World Bank publication joint with the International Monetary Fund. The latest indices and the underlying trade data and elasticity estimates can be download from below. Please cite Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009) if you are using the elasticity estimates, the OTRI, TRI, MAOTRI or the Ad-Valorem Equivalent of Non-tariff measures of any given country.

Services in the trans-pacific partnership : what would be lost?,"As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape future negotiations. The TPPs services component has been hailed as one of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore, new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.
