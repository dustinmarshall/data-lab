166128,Empowering Women Farmers : Evidence from a RandomizedControl Trial in Mozambique,"These results show how a psychological mindset training targeted to women farmers can lead to greater investment and entrepreneurship, helping their households transition out of subsistence farming and into market-oriented agriculture and off-farm businesses. The results also suggest the promise of psychology to improve the design and effectiveness of standard agricultural extension programs, showing the importance of teaching not only best production technologies and practices, but also developing an entrepreneurial mindset.",16-Nov-21,Working Paper,"['Montalvao Machado', 'Joao H.

WPS9840,Knowledge and Adoption of Complex Agricultural Technologies : Evidence from an Extension Experiment,"In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural extension models have become more decentralized and participatory and thus, rely on effective farmer-to-farmer learning, while increasingly including non-traditional forms of education. At the same time, agricultural technologies become more complex and are now often promoted as integrated packages, likely to increase the complexity of the diffusion process. Based on a randomized controlled trial, this study assesses the effects of ‘farmer-to-farmer’ extension and a video intervention on adoption of a complex technology package among 2,382 smallholders in Ethiopia. Both extension-only and extension combined with video increase adoption and knowledge of the package, especially of its more complex components; although on average, there is no additional effect of the video intervention on adoption. Knowledge and the number of adopted practices also increase among farmers not actively participating in extension activities, suggesting information diffusion. For this group, the additional video intervention has a reinforcing effect, and particularly fosters adoption of the integrated package.",5-Nov-21,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Hörner', 'Denise', 'Bouguen', 'Adrien', 'Frölich', 'Markus', 'Wollni', 'Meike']","['Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Fertilizers']",Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/362861636121745084/pdf/Knowledge-and-Adoption-of-Complex-Agricultural-Technologies-Evidence-from-an-Extension-Experiment.pdf
WPS9532,The Demand for Advice : Theory and Empirical Evidence from Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Low levels of investment into modern technologies, and limited use of measures that have low monetary cost but the potential for high yields, are often regarded as obstacles to further agricultural development. This paper investigates farmers’ demand for one such measure, namely agricultural advisory services. These have modest (most frequently zero) monetary user cost but, according to some recent research, have the potential to result in large increases of yields. Yet, demand for these extension services is often low. This study proposes that costly attention may be part of the explanation for this. In the model, advisory services are available free of charge, but positive effects on production are only realized if farmers devote attention to listening to and implementing the provided advice. Modeling farmers as rational decision makers facing scarce attention, the study identifies the circumstances under which farmers may optimally abstain from demanding advisory services. The model complements the insights of other theories commonly used to explain suboptimal farm decisions and outcomes, and generates testable predictions, which are consistent with empirical evidence based on a large farm-level panel dataset from Sub-Saharan Africa.",2-Feb-21,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Naeher', 'Dominik', 'Schundeln', 'Matthias']","['Food Security', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Inequality', 'Information Technology', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry']",Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885441612294787514/pdf/The-Demand-for-Advice-Theory-and-Empirical-Evidence-from-Farmers-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa.pdf
152979,Empowering Farmers to Adopt Agricultural Recommendations,"A quick glance at agricultural input use data from developing countries reveals a large dispersion in take up of improved inputs and practices across farms. One explanation is that this is a problem resulting from limited information, credit constraints, risk, poor input quality, and/or behavioral biases. An alternative view is that farmers are in fact making optimal adoption decisions, and differences among farmers instead reflect heterogeneity in a fixed factor such as soil quality. The authors test whether rainfed farmers in Tlaxcala, Mexico adopt tailored recommendations based on soil analyses and whether productivity improves as a result. The authors vary the level of information specificity (whether recommendations are based on the farmer's own plot or on a larger geographical area) because individually tailored information may be more effective but is also more expensive. The authors also vary whether farmers can choose what inputs to purchase by offering an inflexible grant that subsidizes only the recommended inputs or a flexible one that gives farmers the choice of which inputs to purchase.",1-Sep-20,Brief,[],"['Financial Sector Policy', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Fertilizers', 'Natural Disasters']",DECRG: Finance & Priv Sec Devt (DECFP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/472061600147878799/pdf/Empowering-Farmers-to-Adopt-Agricultural-Recommendations.pdf

The paper uses data from a randomized field experiment that combined localized soil analyses, tailored input recommendations, extension services, and an in-kind grant. The analysis finds that while neither the degree of recommendation specificity (plot versus cluster level) nor the extent of autonomy (defined as the freedom of choice in spending the in-kind grant) had any effect on adoption during the intervention, farmers with autonomy had substantially higher adoption of improved practices two years after the intervention ended.",25-Aug-20,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Corral', 'Carolina', 'Gine', 'Xavier', 'Mahajan', 'Aprajit', 'Seira', 'Enrique']","['Fertilizers', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Economic Assistance', 'Services & Transfers to Poor', 'Disability', 'Access of Poor to Social Services', 'Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing']","Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),DECRG: Finance & Priv Sec Devt (DECFP)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/362001598386078342/pdf/Autonomy-and-Specificity-in-Agricultural-Technology-Adoption-Evidence-from-Mexico.pdf

The study considers global best practices as well as the status of Indonesia in product traceability, e-commerce, agriculture fintech service providers, weather index insurance providers, and precision farming technology providers. Although digital agriculture is cross-cutting across all commodities, the focus was on the horticulture and small ruminant value chains as those were identified as priority commodity categories by the Ministry of Agriculture. The study also offers high-level recommendations for policymakers on reforms and programs that can accelerate the adoption of digital agriculture. In the first section, the national context and the importance of ICT technology in agriculture are summarized. Section two presents the current landscape of digital agriculture in Indonesia, followed by section three that suggests key areas where ICT can play a role in agriculture, based on global experience.

125802,The impact of strengthening agricultural extension services : evidence from Ethiopia,"Extension services have been implemented on a large scale in developing countries for decades. However, there is little evidence on their impact on the productivity and welfare of farmers. Our study aims to begin to fill this evidence gap with the goal of identifying and encouraging the uptake of best practices for the delivery of extension services by governments.Our findings suggest that strengthening extension services to make them more responsive to the needs of farmers can induce a switch to more commercial, market-oriented agriculture.Female-headed households seem to have benefited equally from the extension services project but it did not contribute to reducing the gender gap in agricultural outcomes as their initial levels of wealth and consumption, as well as labor and capital endowments were lower.Additional research is required to identify extension services designs that contribute to closing the gender gap, by addressing more specifically the challenges faced by women in areas such as labor and capital endowment.",1-Apr-18,Brief,"['Buehren', 'Niklas', 'Goldstein', 'Markus P.', 'Molina', 'Ezequiel', 'Vaillant', 'Julia']","['Inequality', 'Food Security', 'Gender and Development', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension']",Global Themes Department- Gender (GTGDR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/788651524747997140/pdf/BRI-GILEthiopiaStrengtheningAgricultureBrief-PUBLIC.pdf

124214,"Key steps to improve agribusiness competitiveness part II : research and development, logistics, and marketing","Agriculture is central to emerging market economies. In Africa it accounts for as much as 65 percent of employment and 32 percent of output. Globally, two-thirds of the world’s poor - some 750 million people - work in rural areas. But as economies expand and production shifts to manufacturing and services, agriculture’s share of employment, and gross domestic product (GDP) decreases. At the same time, the broader agribusiness industry - business activities performed from farm to fork - is playing a more important role in growth and development. Improved land rights, better regulation of input and output markets, and better access to seeds and fertilizer are all critical to this transition. In part II, the emphasis is on a shift of research and development (R and D) spending from the public sector to private enterprises in middle-income countries focused on market opportunities related to advanced technologies and knowledge transfers. And a new emphasis on agricultural marketing, logistics, and market data is helping to integrate small farms into agricultural value chains, with higher prices for their products, greater productivity growth, and more sustainable overall development.",1-Jan-18,Brief,"['Walton', 'Tom', 'Grishin', 'Vadim Nikolaevich']","['Food Security', 'Food & Beverage Industry', 'Plastics & Rubber Industry', 'Agribusiness', 'Common Carriers Industry', 'Textiles', 'Apparel & Leather Industry', 'Pulp & Paper Industry', 'Business Cycles and Stabilization Policies', 'Transport Services', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Information Technology']",Economics & Priv Sector Develop (CEDVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/404071520919641918/pdf/124214-BRI-EMCompass-Note-50-R2-PUBLIC.pdf

The paper examines the impact of the Rural Capacity Building Project using panel data on 1,485 geographically dispersed households in project and control kebeles. The results show that the strengthening of extension services had a positive impact on economic participation in the household, land area cultivated, and adoption of marketable crops, suggesting that access to extension helped farmers switch to more commercial, market-oriented agriculture.

This study systematically measures seasonal price gaps at 193 markets for 13 food commodities in seven African countries. It shows that the commonly used dummy variable or moving average deviation methods to estimate the seasonalgap can yield substantial upward bias. This can be partially circumvented using trigonometric and sawtooth models, which are more parsimonious. Among staple crops, seasonality is highest for maize (33 percent on average) and lowest for rice (16½ percent). This is two and a half to three times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across market places but maize isthe only crop in which there are important systematic country effects.

But what are the consequences for nutritional outcomes? The evidence to date has been scant and inconclusive. This study contributes to the debate by revisiting two prevailing wisdoms: (a) market participation by African smallholders remains low; and (b) the impact of commercialization on nutritional outcomes is generally positive.Using nationally representative data from three African countries, the analysis reveals high levels of commercialization by even the poorest and smallest landholders, with rates of market participation as high as 90 percent. Female farmers participate less, but tend to sell larger shares of their production, conditionalon participation. Second, we find little evidence of a positive relationship between commercialization and nutritional status.

The authors run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. The authors track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs.

This study designed a field experiment to test whether eliciting feedback can empower users and increase demand for a service. The study randomly assigned different feedback tools in the context of an agricultural service to document their impact on clients' demand and shed light on the underlying mechanisms. The analysis shows large demand effects, in the current and following growing periods. It also documents large demand effect spillovers, as other non-client farmers in the vicinity of treated groups are more likely to sign up for the service. To disentangle pure supply-side monitoring from demand-side accountability effects, additional monitoring was randomly announced to extension workers across treatment and control communities. Extension workers do not exert significantly more effort in villages where additional monitoring takes place.

WPS7669,Will digital technologies transform agriculture in developing countries,"Mobile phones and the internet have significantly affected practically all sectors of the economy, and agriculture is no exception. Building on a recent World Bank flagship report, this paper introduces a concise framework for describing the main benefits from new information and communications technologies. They promote greater inclusion in the broader economy, raise efficiency by complementing other production factors, and foster innovation by dramatically reducing transaction costs. The paper reviews the recent literature on corresponding technology impacts in the rural sector in developing countries. Digital technologies overcome information problems that hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, increase knowledge through new ways of providing extension services, and they provide novel ways for improving agricultural supply chain management. Although there are many promising examples of positive impacts on rural livelihoods--or ""digital dividends""--often these have not scaled up to the extent expected. The main reason is that technology can only address some, but not all, of the barriers faced by farmers in the poorer countries.",11-May-16,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Deichmann', 'Uwe Klaus', 'Goyal', 'Aparajita', 'Mishra', 'Deepak K.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Telecommunications Infrastructure', 'Food Security', 'Transport Services']",Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481581468194054206/pdf/WPS7669.pdf
94887,Improved nutrition through agricultural extension and advisory services : case studies of curriculum review and operational lessons from India,"Even after several decades of green revolution, malnutrition continues to be a major development challenge in much of South Asia, and India has a major share of the malnourished people in the region. For nutrition goals to be integrated into extension the curricula provided to current and future agricultural extension agents must be revisited. As part of the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI), this paper focuses on approaches to incorporating such nutrition content into the agricultural extension curriculum. Three state agricultural universities in Tamil Nadu, united Andhra Pradesh, and Bihar were used as case studies for the curriculum review. Through these case studies, face-to-face consultations at the national level down to program implementation at the village level have been developed. These include consultative workshops, and a conceptual framework and strategy for incorporating nutrition into extension curriculum development to improve nutrition outcomes. This strategy, detailed in this report, includes opportunities for collaboration from the national level to the community level. Specific lessons and follow-up actions are outlined that may be useful for other South Asian countries. The paper is organized as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two reviews current literature on agriculture-nutrition linkages to develop a conceptual framework for integrating nutrition into agricultural extension programs. Research methods and approaches are given in chapter three. Results and discussions are given in chapter four. Lessons from the case studies are presented in chapter five, and chapter six consists of concluding remarks.",1-Feb-16,Working Paper,"['Babu', 'Suresh Chandra', 'Singh', 'Meera', 'Hymavathi', 'T.

96335,Fostering agriculture-nutrition links : recommendations for agriculture extension curriculum reforms in India,"Malnutrition continues to be a major development challenge in the South Asia region. Given its size, India hosts the majority of the malnourished. Around 300 million people in India do not have access to a food supply that sufficiently meets their basic energy needs. Despite recent economic growth, poverty remains high, and malnutrition is now manifest in all its forms with overweight and obesity increasing alongside persistent under nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. The progress made between 1970 and 2010 in reducing malnutrition was largely due to improving access to safe water, female education, and female empowerment, the latter especially key in South Asia. The factor that made the least progress between 1995 and 2010 is increasing quantity and quality of food, clearly a responsibility of agriculture. Finally, extension efforts must recognize women farmers, and deliver programs directly to them for two reasons. First, women in most households are intimately involved in the production and preparation of meals and feeding their family, and so they have the most direct control over nutrition. Second, female-headed households in India typically have a higher incidence of malnutrition and food insecurity.",1-May-15,Brief,"['Babu', 'Suresh Chandra', 'Havimo', 'Terhi Elisa', 'Pehu', 'Eija']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Nutrition', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security']",Agriculture - GP (GFADR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/356241468000285306/pdf/96335-BRI-P145591-Box391433B-PUBLIC-AG-GP-Note-02-web.pdf

WPS7000,Seeing is believing evidence from an extension network experiment,"Extension is designed to enable lab-to-farm technology diffusion. Decentralized models assume that information flows from researchers to extension workers, and from extension agents to contact farmers (CFs). CFs should then train other farmers in their communities. Such a modality may fail to address informational inefficiencies and accountability issues. The authors run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. They track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs. However, higher levels of CF adoption have limited impact on the behavior of other farmers.",1-Aug-14,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Kondylis', 'Florence', 'Mueller', 'Valerie', 'Zhu', 'Siyao Jessica']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Demographics', 'Hydrology', 'Food Security']","DEC Strategy & Operations (DECSO),Development Impact Evaluation (DIME0)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/647501468003943080/pdf/WPS7000.pdf
89824,Decision-making and investment strategies for managing flood risk in Guyana : Estrategias de toma de decisiones e inversion para la gestion del riesgo de inundaciones en Guyana,"This issue focuses on ways to tackle persistent flooding and economic vulnerabilities in the agricultural sector for Guyana. In January 2005 extreme and prolonged rainfall caused widespread flooding in Guyana with flood levels elevated well above safe operating levels, putting the East Demerara Water Conservancy reservoir and dam at risk of overtopping and catastrophic breaching. In an effort to tackle persistent flooding and economic vulnerabilities in the agricultural sector, the Government of Guyanas Ministry of Agriculture, along with the World Bank and other international development agencies, initiated the US$3.8 million Conservancy Adaptation Project (CAP). A top priority identified under the CAP initiative is the strengthening of the Conservancy and coastal drainage systems to protect the country's key economic and most populated regions. The CAP focused on four main areas: 1) pre-investment studies and data collection for engineering design of works; 2) critical drainage infrastructure investments; 3) institutional strengthening and capacity building; and 4) building national awareness of flood risk. CAP has been a flagship project and a launching pad for significant progress in flood risk mitigation measures for Guyana and also the Caribbean region. Key outcomes of the project include a hydraulic engineering foundation for the dam; increased safety of the Conservancy and reduced vulnerability to catastrophic flooding through physical investments; enhanced government knowledge and capacity to manage the Conservancy and coastal drainage systems; comprehensive scenario analyses and dam stability to improve decision-making of Conservancy investments; and a US$123 million package of pre-designed infrastructure and nonstructural investments critical for flood risk management. These investments will generate increased capacity to manage water levels in the Conservancy and lessen the high vulnerability of the people and agricultural areas in the region to moderate and extreme climate events.",1-Jul-14,Brief,[],"['Agricultural Extension', 'Disaster Management', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Agricultural Economics']","Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/610571468250857601/pdf/898240BRI0INSI00Box385287B00PUBLIC0.pdf

80766,Determinants of agricultural extension services : the case of Haiti,"The Haitian population is among the poorest in the world, with over 78 percent living on less than United States (U.S.) 2 dollar a day and over 50 percent living on less than U.S. 1 dollar a day. This paper extracts relevant lessons from historical data on factors influencing the receipt of extension services in Haiti, taking stock of the use of agricultural extension services prior to the 2010 earthquake. The goal is to influence future policies and development projects involving the provision of extension services as well as the type of extension services offered. This paper uses data from the 2010 agricultural census and examines the characteristics of farmers in Haiti receiving extension services by gender, education, agricultural training, farm size, and type of crop. Through in-depth study of each variable and a review of trends in the receipt of agricultural extension services, the study analyzes the equilibrium between the demand for and supply of extension services to particular farmer groups. The study draws the following nine key conclusions: (1) the proportion of households receiving agricultural extension services in Haiti is non-negligible; (2) location is an important determinant of the recipients of agricultural extension services; (3) there are no statistical differences between men and women in terms of receipt of extension services; however, the impact of agricultural training and farm size change when the head of household is a woman; (4) education level has a positive, yet small, effect on receiving extension services; (5) prior agricultural training is a major determinant of the recipients of extension services; (6) rehabilitation of the Ecoles Moyennes Agricoles (EMAs) for vocational and farmer field education on a nationwide scale will increase the demand for extension services, especially among small farmers; (7) farmers with larger farms receive more agricultural extension services; (8) coffee producers make more use of extension services than other farmers; and (9) promoting a hybrid system of extension may be more efficient than supporting only public or Non-governmental organizations (NGO) provided extension services.",24-May-13,Working Paper,"['Arias', 'Diego', 'Leguia', 'Juan Jose', 'Sy', 'Abdoulaye']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Educational Sciences', 'Gender and Development', 'Economics and Gender', 'Gender and Poverty', 'Gender and Economic Policy', 'Gender and Economics']",Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/253911468035659595/pdf/807660WP0P12670Box0379820B00PUBLIC0.pdf
79421,Improving technology adoption in agriculture through extension services : evidence from Uruguay,"This paper evaluates whether cost-sharing public interventions are successful in promoting agricultural technology uptake by small and medium farmers, and whether these changes can affect yields. The paper contributes to the debate by providing empirical evidence, which is scarce in the literature, from a program offering extension services to fruit producers in Uruguay. Using a unique panel dataset, the authors estimate a fixed effects model for the impact of extension services on technology adoption and yields. The authors find evidence that the program increased density of plantation. Once small sample issues are addressed, the authors also find some evidence of impact on the adoption of improved varieties. However, the authors find no evidence of impact on yields for the period under study. Although this lack of effects on yields can be due to the limited timeframe of the evaluation and does not rule out effects on other measures of productivity, it may also indicate that the practices promoted by the program are insufficient to induce a detectable impact on productivity and, consequently, sustainable benefits for the farmers. The study, therefore, confirms the need of including the design of impact evaluations in the policy design in order to properly consider the timing of all the potential effects and produce conclusive findings and precise recommendations.",8-Mar-13,Journal Article,"['Cerdan-Infantes', 'Pedro', 'Maffioli', 'Alessandro', 'Ubfal', 'Diego Javier', 'Vazquez Bare', 'Gonzalo']","['Agricultural Extension', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Educational Sciences', 'Economic Forecasting', 'Macroeconomic Management', 'Governance Diagnostic Capacity Building']",Education Sector Unit (EASHE),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/441051528961112382/pdf/794210JRN0Impr00Box0379855B00OUO090.pdf

The report begins (section one) with an overview of agriculture's role in Azerbaijan's economy, the strategic need for increased agricultural growth and the technical, economic and policy constraints impeding growth. Section two reviews the Bank's lending program and analytical work, and considers the appropriate balance between lending and analytical activities. Section three assesses the Bank's impact on agricultural productivity, and section four considers how environmental management, social welfare and agricultural growth can be mutually complementary. Section five and six reviews cross-cutting aspects of the Bank's work in Azerbaijan's agriculture sector, including the Bank's effectiveness as an innovator and as a partner with the government in agricultural reform. And section seven assesses the impact of the Bank's own institutional structure and practices on its operational effectiveness promoting agricultural productivity. Concluding the report, Section 8 highlights the main areas where the Bank could have had greater impact on the country's agricultural productivity, and the lessons thereby emerging for the Bank's agricultural role in Azerbaijan in future years.",29-Jul-11,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Oblitas', 'Keith Robert A.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'State Owned Enterprise Reform', 'Public Sector Administrative & Civil\n            Service Reform', 'Hydrology', 'Food Security', 'Privatization', 'Energy Privatization', 'Inequality', 'Democratic Government', 'Economics and Finance of Public\n            Institution Development', 'Public Sector Administrative and Civil\n            Service Reform', 'De Facto Governments']","Country, Corporate & Global Eval (IEGCC)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/575981468010221499/pdf/653560NWP0Box30anWorkingPaper201103.pdf

However, raising rural living standards remains a formidable challenge. Roughly 85 percent of Solomon Islanders live in rural areas, relying on subsistence, smallholder agriculture. Agriculture remains the backbone of the rural economy. As such, the Rural Development Program (RDP) is designed to respond to priorities identified by villagers to improve agricultural extension services, and rural infrastructure. The RDP has been prepared as the first phase of a long term program to support the Solomon Islands national rural development goals. With funding from AusAID, the European Union and the World Bank, the RDP, which is implemented by the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock in collaboration with the Provincial Governments, aims to raise the living standards of rural households.

69363,Afghanistan - Supporting female saffron producers in value addition activities in Herat Province (Vol. 3) : Saffron value chain forum for women in Herat,"This report describes a project to improve the lives of female saffron producers in Herat Province, Afghanistan. Women have a significant role in saffron production, amounting to 80 percent of the total work, with most of the work in harvesting, processing and packaging, but a very limited role in marketing and price negotiation with traders; men usually take over during the marketing stage of the spice. Given the role of women in saffron production and its potential for empowering women through engagement in economic activities, the Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees (DACAAR) supported the establishment of a female saffron association in 2006 in Pashtun Zarghun district (Herat province) with initial membership of 70 women. Currently, the association has 175 members and has distributed 3,000 kg of saffron corm to 157 women up to the end of 2010. The pilot project performed the following activities: conducted a workshop to establish a Saffron Stakeholder Forum in Herat; selected activities to promote economic empowerment of women through improving womens position in the saffron value chain; conducted a workshop with saffron stakeholders to document lessons learned (Annex C); developed an Operational Manual and illustrative posters; and documented final lessons learned (Annex B). This report also outlines the achievements in terms of output and activities and the result of subprojects implemented by two women saffron producers'sassociations.",15-Apr-10,Working Paper,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Fertilizers', 'Educational Sciences', 'Gender and Development', 'Food Security']","Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/216141467994718654/pdf/693630ESW0P1170omments0170Feb02011.pdf
56582,"Gender and governance in agricultural extension services : insights from India, Ghana, and Ethiopia","The gender and governance in rural services insights from India, Ghana, and Ethiopia report aims to generate policy-relevant knowledge on strategies for improving agricultural service delivery, with a focus on providing more equitable access to these services, especially for women. The project has been implemented in India, Ghana, and Ethiopia. These countries were chosen to capture variation in important macro-factors, especially the level of economic development; various aspects of governance, such as political system and party system; the role of women in society; and strategies adopted to promote gender equity. The project focused on agricultural extension as an example of a critical agricultural service. In India, the main problem is the lack of overall capacity resulting from a past policy of not hiring agricultural extension providers. The study indicates that access to agricultural extension is low in Ghana, despite the fact that an extension agent-to-farmer ratio is comparatively high. Agricultural extension is a high for the Ethiopia government priority, but coverage of extension services across regions varies widely, and extension agents have limited discretion to adapt technology packages to the context of individual communities. The gender gap in access to extension can also be improved.",1-Mar-10,Brief,"['Madhvani', 'Sonia', 'Pehu', 'Eija']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Gender and Development', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/692491468268162942/pdf/565820BRI0Box31ARD1GandG1Note531web.pdf
56587,"Strengthening agricultural extension and advisory systems : procedures for assessing, transforming, and evaluating extension systems","The purpose of this paper is to provide information on how to transform and strengthen pluralistic agricultural extension and advisory systems in moving toward the broader goal of increasing farm income and improving rural livelihoods. The focus of this book is primarily on the technical knowledge, management skills, and information services that small-scale farm households will need to improve their livelihoods in the rapidly changing global economy. In addition, the book will also include information on how extension should help all types of farmers in dealing with escalating natural resource problems, including climate change. The primary focus of this paper will be a comparative analysis of different extension strategies, organizational models, institutional innovations, and resource constraints and how an extension system might be transformed and strengthened through specific policy and organizational changes as well as needed investments. This paper is organized into nine chapters. These chapters follow an institution building strategy used by many donors and governments as they seek to improve their extension system.

This strategy considers science and technology as core elements of agricultural sector policy, and the allocation of funds is governed by principles of cost-effectiveness and transparency. The fact that Latin American (LAC) countries, especially Colombia, are commonly endowed with a high concentrations of biodiversity (habitats and species) compared to other regions of the world, generates significant opportunities for RTDI. These projects offer a systematic way of making use of biodiversity in life sciences aimed at solving problems (e.g. a new disease-resistant variety of a traditional crop) or generating commercial returns (e.g. a native fruit that can be domesticated, harvested and industrialized). Moreover, proposals were typically submitted by research entities (universities and research centers) that were often disconnected from the needs of the productive sector and which often generated results scarcely relevant to producers.",1-Dec-07,Brief,"['Cristancho', 'Edwin', 'Ekanayake', 'Indira Janaki', 'Janssen', 'Willem']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Biodiversity', 'Global Environment Facility', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Education Information &\n            Communications Technologies', 'Educational Institutions & Facilities', 'Educational Informatics', 'Food Security']","Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/519841468241781902/pdf/538080BRI0En0B10Box345626B01PUBLIC1.pdf

The project is ongoing, but initial surveys suggest that farmers in those counties covered by the project are adopting technologies that lead to real improvements in yields and farm incomes.

39243,Restructuring Uganda's coffee industry : why going back to the basics matters,"Uganda's coffee industry consists of low input-intensity smallholders with an average farm size of 0.2 hectares and is the main source of income for an estimated 500,000 households. Following its introduction earlier in the 20th century, the industry expanded considerably during the 1950s and 1960s. However, the sector experienced a huge setback due to the civil strife of the 1970s, when output halved within a 5-year period (1972-77). During the late 1980s, the sector went through a liberalization process, which, coupled with high world prices, led to considerable supply response, with exports exceeding 4 million bags in two consecutive years (1995 and 1996), the only time in the sector's history. By all accounts, the reforms have been successful. Producers' share of export prices doubled and growers receive payments promptly. Entrepreneurial activity has increased enormously. Most important, there has been a well documented poverty reduction impact on households of the coffee growing regions. There has been no backtracking of reforms.",1-Mar-07,Brief,"['Baffes', 'John']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Ports & Waterways', 'Hydrology', 'International Trade and Trade Rules', 'Inequality']",Off. of Regional Vice President (AFRVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/765561468111858141/pdf/392430UG0Coffee0find27201PUBLIC1.pdf

61921,Institutional innovation in agricultural research and extension systems in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Agricultural modernization is a key element in the development strategy of almost all Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Agriculture in LAC is just too important as an economic sector to be ignored. Primary agriculture employs on average about 20 percent of the population in the region, has significant forward and backward linkages to the rest of the economy (creating jobs in agricultural processing and, to a lesser extent, in agricultural input industries), and generates important export income. Raising agricultural productivity is key in making agriculture more competitive in rapidly liberalizing world markets (due to free trade agreements with the United States and other LAC countries), as well as increasing the incomes of rural populations (many of which are desperately poor). This study aims to review these institutional reform experiences on the basis of a literature review and seven case studies on specific experiences in different LAC countries. The case studies were conducted in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Some of these countries had World Bank funded agricultural research and extension projects (e.g. Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil), while the agricultural institutional reform process in all countries was driven by the countries~^!!^ needs and desire for change and improvement in the sector. The study tries to distill lessons from these experiences and provide guidance to key policy makers in national governments, the World Bank and other development partners on potential problems and issues regarding agricultural research and extension services that need to be tackled at the institutional and policy levels. It also attempts to reshape the thinking behind development strategies relating to the agriculture and rural sectors.",1-Jun-06,Working Paper,"['Roseboom', 'Johannes']","['Agricultural Research', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Agriculture and Farming Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Nutrition', 'Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems', 'Food Security', 'Educational Institutions & Facilities', 'Educational Informatics', 'Education Information &\n            Communications Technologies']","Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802321468300697976/pdf/Institutional-innovation-in-agricultural-research-and-extension-systems-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf

A multivariate analysis of the changes in integrated pest management knowledge in Indonesia among follower farmers over the period 1991-98 indicates that opinion leaders who are superior to followers, but not excessively so, are more effective in transmitting knowledge. Excessive socioeconomic distance is shown to reduce the effectiveness of diffusion.

37047,Institutional reform of agricultural research and extension in Latin America and the Caribbean,"After a period of strong support in the 1960s and 1970s, public funding for research and extension activities in LAC began to wane in the 1980s and 1990s. The strained economic context for many countries required the search for more cost-effective and efficient strategies for producing, disseminating and applying new knowledge and information in agriculture. At the same time, the demand for innovation became all the more pressing, as increased global competition required improvements in agricultural productivity. Consequently, many countries in the region in recent years have sought to revitalize their agricultural research and extension systems through a series of sustainability of funding for these services. Reflective of the drivers of reform, the focus has been on the following principles: 1) diversification in execution and funding; 2) allocation of funding on a competitive basis; 3) demand-driven financing; 4) empowerment of local communities; and, 5) increased private sector participation in implementation of the reform agenda. A series of case studies from the LAC region, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, were conducted to review these institutional reform experiences in agriculture and distill lessons learned to further advance agricultural innovation systems in the region. The following summarizes some of the key trends in both agricultural research and extension based on the analysis of these varied country experiences.",1-May-06,Brief,"['Roseboom', 'Johannes', 'McMahon', 'Matthew', 'Ekanayake', 'Indira', 'John-Abraham', 'Indu']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agriculture and Farming Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems', 'Nutrition', 'International Trade and Trade Rules', 'Food Security']",LCR Regional Vice President (LCRVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/786181468025434965/pdf/370470ENGLISH01gInnovation01PUBLIC1.pdf
WPS3928,The rise and fall of training and visit extension : an Asian mini-drama with an African epilogue,"The paper reviews the origins and evolution of the Training and Visit (T&V) extension system, which was promoted by the World Bank in 1975-98 in over 50 developing countries. The discussion seeks to clarify the context within which the approach was implemented, and to analyze the causes for its lack of sustainability and its ultimate abandonment. The paper identifies some of the challenges faced by the T&V approach as being typical of a large public extension system, where issues of scale, interaction with the agricultural research systems, inability to attribute benefits, weak accountability, and lack of political support tend to lead to incentive problems among staff and managers of extension, and limited budgetary resources. The different incentives and outlook of domestic stakeholders and external donor agencies are also reviewed. The main cause of the T&V system's disappearance is attributed to the incompatibility of its high recurrent costs with the limited budgets available domestically, leading to fiscal unsustainability. The paper concludes with some lessons that apply to donor-driven public extension initiatives, and more generally to rural development fads. The role of timely, independent, and rigorous evaluative studies is specifically highlighted.",1-May-06,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Anderson', 'Jock R.', 'Feder', 'Gershon', 'Ganguly', 'Sushma']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",Development Research Group (DECRG),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/190121468140386154/pdf/wps3928.pdf
38268,Impact evaluation - the experience of the independent evaluation group of the World Bank,"The term impact evaluation has had many meanings in the past and continues to be used in various ways. In this study, the particular definition used here - counterfactual analysis of final welfare outcomes - is one which implies the need for a rigorous approach to establishing the counterfactual. Two problems arise when attempting to do this - contamination and selection bias. Impact evaluation is approached in various ways. The current emphasis on rigor is important but should not lead to the neglect of aspects of evaluation design which ensure its policy relevance. Adopting a theory-based approach is the best way of ensuring such relevance, since it will yield information on how the program is working not just if it is working. In IEG's experience, rigorous impact evaluation is expensive. This high cost is one reason why impact evaluation, whilst an important part of the evaluation toolkit, cannot reasonably be expected to be carried out for any but a relatively small percentage of total operations. It is therefore important to select subjects carefully so as to build up a collection of policy-relevant knowledge. The case studies researched by the authors include: improving the quantity and quality of basic education in Ghana; meeting the health Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in Bangladesh; the Bangladesh integrated nutrition project; and agricultural extension services in Kenya.",1-Jan-06,Working Paper,"['Barbu', 'Alain A.', 'White', 'Howard Nial']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Health Care Services Industry', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Nutrition', 'Hydrology', 'Law and Justice Institutions']",Sector Evaluations (IEGSE),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/475491468138595632/pdf/382680Impact1e10experience01PUBLIC1.pdf

44546,Gender dimensions of agricultural knowledge and innovation systems,"In agriculture, the generation of new technologies and the creative imitation of the existing stock of technologies can promote productivity and growth. The important elements in mapping the enabling factors for innovation are: (a) realistic assessment of the country- or region-specific potential in human, physical, and economic terms; and (b) identifying technologies to realize that potential, through adapting the existing stock, and through networking between researchers and other innovators (agricultural research organizations, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), private companies, farmers and rural communities). Gender inclusiveness is essential in all of these stakeholder groups. This innovation system process has important gender dimensions, many of which are rapidly evolving. Men and women in the rural sector frequently grow different crops, rear different livestock, and perform different agricultural tasks. As the share of female-headed household increases, these distinctions become less clear and women take on activities that were previously undertaken by men. But certain activities tend to remain women's responsibility, particularly growing food crops, and post harvest activities ranging from crop preservation to processing and storage. Women are also increasingly taking advantage of employment opportunities in high-value crops, such as fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, and flowers, which offer farmers the opportunity to compete for a share of export markets.",1-Jun-05,Brief,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Gender and Development', 'Food Security']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/128311468155966283/pdf/445460BRI0BOX311Ard0BRIEF101PUBLIC1.pdf
32002,Republica Dominicana : implicaciones del tratado de libre comercio con Estados Unidos de America respecto al sector agropecuario,"The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed in August 2004, between the Dominican Republic (DR) and the United States of America (US), contains a specific chapter on agriculture. Concurrently, the financial crisis the Government of the Dominican Republic is going through, will hamper the support provided to the agricultural sector. It is within this context the potential impacts of the FTA on agricultural policies and institutions are assessed herewith, and a number of recommendations are provided to ensure the agricultural sector benefits from the FTA provisions. Following are the main findings of the study. Regarding DR's agricultural exports to the US, 84 percent of these exports already benefit from the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) preferential treatment, while 14 percent enters the US under free access conditions; thus, in the short term, the possibilities for expanded exports are not significantly higher than prior to the FTA approval. This new accord basically turns permanent the already existing preferential treatment under the CBI and the Caribbean Basin Partnership Trade Act. Concerning imports, the new accord provides for new import quotas on sensitive products (rice, sugar, and beans) to start at very low levels, to then progress to a long-term period of ten to twenty years, at which time they will be abolished. Therefore, the immediate impact on internal consumption of crops will be very limited. However, in the medium and long term the FTA could achieve important, positive impacts: non-traditional export products (i.e., tomatoes, avocados, mangoes, and bananas), show a strong comparative advantage. The cost structure of these products carry a high labor intensive level, though potentially low in developing economies of scale, and, are especially apt for small and medium scale production in the DR. The report suggests, first, the country's new policies could focus on the provision of public goods, raising the agricultural sector competitiveness, instead of rather subsidizing private sector goods. Agricultural extension and research should be strengthened, agricultural technology developed, as well as livestock and agricultural sanitary services, quality control, market development information, agricultural experts and entrepreneurial training provision, creditability, and improved export promotion services, such as transport, banking services, and public transactions. Second, the country should reduce economic support and protection of non-competitive crops (beans, rice) in favor of those potentially competitive (perennials, fruits, high valued vegetables, and some animal products).Third, regarding fiscal issues, savings could be achieved among various agricultural support programs, by removing current financial assistance practices to agriculture, which supports the provision of private goods. Finally, institutional reforms should be implemented, needed to ensure the implementation and feasibility of new policies.",1-Mar-05,Working Paper,[],"['Agricultural Research', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Trade', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Agricultural Economics']",Sustainable Development Dept (LCSSD),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/335201468249023463/pdf/320020rev.pdf

The main export producers are large-scale farmers. Even with the change in discriminatory legislation and practices in South Africa after 1994, few smallholder farmers have penetrated this market. The few smallholders who manage to export their fruit do so through collective or individual arrangements with large-scale commercial operations. One such farmer is Aubrey Billet from Haarlem. He started exporting apples in the 1970s. Over the decades, he developed his own knowledge and innovations in both fruit production and socio-economic arrangements and was able to continue exporting most of his annual apple crop.

31892,"Demand-driven approaches to agriculture extension : Case studies of international initiatives, vol. 3","Demand-led is a relatively recent label for a notion that has been around since people began to write about extension as an academic discipline and educational practice. It captures the idea that the information, advice and other services offered by extension professionals should be tailored to the expressed demands of the clients or recipients of the service: not just to their ""needs"" as identified by various stakeholders (government, corporations, scientists, extension professionals ), but the things they say they want. The case studies in this section are less concerned with specific techniques and methods, and more with making institutional changes, which will lead extension service providers to be more responsive to what clients want. In most cases, this involves changing the distribution of power and responsibilities among three key sets of actors: (a) clients, (b) those who deliver the service, and (c) government. Many of the cases described in other sections of this book also have responsiveness to client demand high on their list of objectives. This is a primary rationale for privatization. In the eleven cases brought together here, the main thrust of extension reform has been improving the responsiveness of services funded entirely or substantially by governments, with or without support from donors, to client demand.",1-Jan-04,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Alex', 'Gary', 'ed.', 'Rivera', 'William', 'ed.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/184731468298459108/pdf/318920Extension1Reform1V31final.pdf

Listed below, are some of the changes that have affected public sector extension services. 1. The state financial crises that lead to a sharp decrease in overall public investments, leading to pressure to downsize and consider more cost-efficient extension methods away from the labor intensive, Train and Visit (T&V) management type approaches. 2. The increasing criticisms of poor performance of public services extension such as (a) their lack of accountability to clients; (b) the lack of relevance and quality of their programs, due to poorly trained extension agents; (c) their limited coverage, in terms of area and type of clients, as they insufficiently address the needs of the poor, women farmers, and farmers in disadvantaged areas; and (d) their lack of sustainability. 3. The emergence of other actors and service providers that can disseminate agricultural knowledge and information; in particular, producer organizations, NGOs, and private sector. 4. The political forces linked to democratization, liberalization, and decentralization which in conjunction with financial constraints and emerging new actors, leads to redefining the role of public services and rethinking extension methods away from top-down, supply-driven approaches. 5. The revolution in information and communication technologies which provides new vehicles for supplying information. 6. The changes in agriculture and, therefore, in the information needs of farmers. Extension has to embrace a broadened mandate such as information on marketing. There is also growing public concern about environmental conservation and poverty reduction, which adds to the extension mandate.

31890,"Decentralized systems : Case studies of international initiatives, vol. 1","This compilation highlights major reforms being instituted today at the beginning of the 21st century. These reforms include decentralization, privatization, demand-driven approaches, the revitalization within public sector services, and national strategy and reform processes. Comprised of 44 case studies, the compilation is organized into five main parts, each with an overview of the issues by an extension specialist that participated in the international workshop. The case studies are organized by focus on: (a) decentralization, (b) private service delivery (including privatization, contracting for delivery of service, and private market-based services), (c) demand-driven approaches (including demand-driven programs, participatory approaches and producer organizations), (d) revitalization within public sector services, and (e) national strategy and reform process. A concluding note follows the compilation, bringing the total to 45 chapters. Some 39 different countries are covered.This case study, Section one, underscores how extension is being affected by global trends toward decentralization of public administration and services. In China, the central government's delegation of authority to the provincial, prefecture and county levels has been instrumental to the success of public sector reform. In Uganda, the government has taken steps to restructure ministries, decentralize services, divest public companies, and generally privatize the economy. In India, decentralization initiatives are largely oriented to promoting user participation in local extension activities. Nicaragua and Vietnam illustrate the challenges of linking extension to poverty reduction, as empowerment of the poor in negotiations with institutions of Government and the market are important to improving livelihoods. Ghana and Trinidad and Tobago, which transferred management and technical functions from the central extension administration to regional offices in the 1990s, are examples of ""incomplete"" decentralization reforms. Extension services are quite decentralized with strong client participation mechanisms in many of the other country case studies, where extension systems are relatively effective (e.g., Australia, China, Germany, United Kingdom).",1-Jan-04,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Alex', 'Gary', 'ed.', 'Rivera', 'William', 'ed.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'State Owned Enterprise Reform', 'Public Sector Administrative & Civil\n            Service Reform', 'Food Security', 'Privatization', 'Energy Privatization', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality', 'Democratic Government', 'Economics and Finance of Public\n            Institution Development', 'Public Sector Administrative and Civil\n            Service Reform', 'De Facto Governments']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/170431468291370533/pdf/318900Extension1Reform1V1.pdf
42186,Strategic communication for the design of agricultural policies and for their implementation,"This paper points out that development policies for rural areas are marked by very different perspectives, sectors of intervention, and goals. Some policies tend to focus only on agriculture, whereas other policies have a more articulated food chain approach. Other policies recognize the need for infra-structural investments first, in order to reduce some bottlenecks that impede economic growth. In other cases, diversification of the economic structure has been sought and non agricultural activities have been pursued in order to create a wealth that the primary sector alone can not generate. In some other cases, major emphasis has been given to structural problems, such as access to land or land registration, or to institutional aspects, such as public sector reform or institution building. The paper concludes that the design of policies for sustainable agriculture and rural development requires a comprehensive approach, which could enhance the energies of all stakeholders and provide the necessary tools for overcoming difficulties.",30-Dec-03,Working Paper,"['Calabrese', 'Daniele', 'Grenna', 'Lucia', 'Santucci', 'Fabio Maria']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food & Nutrition Policy', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",Development Communications (EXTCD),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/168211468313533223/pdf/421860strcommagrpol01PULBIC1.pdf

The report notes that this is an important milestone in a process that has been ongoing since the 2000 Business Meeting and Initial General Assembly of SSATP. Those meetings began the SSATP Strategic Review and formulation of new governance arrangements. The outputs of the Strategic Review resulted in demands being expressed by country coordinators for the transport sector to better demonstrate its contribution to poverty reduction and for a move towards a more integrated, programmatic approach within SSATP. The strategic goal of the program is to ensure that transport sector strategies are firmly anchored in overarching poverty reduction strategies was established at the 2002 SSATP Stakeholders' Meeting in Maputo, Mozambique. The guidelines are designed with a participatory methodology for the comparative assessment, which was tested out by three countries: Guinea, Rwanda and Tanzania during the first half of 2003. These guidelines are the result of the experimentation and verification by transport and poverty reduction strategy personnel in sub-Saharan Africa.",1-Dec-03,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Braithwaite', 'Mary']","['Trade Policy', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Education for the Knowledge Economy', 'Knowledge Economy', 'Educational Technology and Distance Education']",Transport Practice Group (AFTTR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/751421468246643208/pdf/298530English0SSATP0no1077.pdf
WPS3170,Direct support to private firms - evidence on effectiveness,"Governments use a variety of instruments to provide direct support to private enterprises. These include the provision of finance (subsidized and/or directed credit) and business development services (management and marketing advice to small businesses, agricultural extension services, support for enterprise level training and support to technology development). These interventions are distinct from those that support enterprises indirectly by establishing a policy and legal environment conducive to enterprise development. How effective have these direct support schemes been? This paper attempts to provide some answers to this question by surveying the available literature on the effectiveness of direct support interventions. Where available, impact evaluations suggest that the performance has been mixed at best. The evidence indicates that active intervention does not work unless the basic environment for private sector development is sound. Public policy thus needs to focus on creating an enabling environment, key elements of which include a sound legal and judicial system which supports low-cost contract enforcement, good infrastructure, a policy playing field which is level in terms of ease of registration, taxes and investment incentives for all enterprises-large and small, domestic and foreign.",30-Nov-03,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Batra', 'Geeta;Mahmood', 'Syed A.;']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Skills Development and Labor Force Training', 'Rural Microfinance and SMEs', 'Microfinance', 'Financial Intermediation', 'Rural Finance']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/514951468779353903/pdf/wps3170.pdf
27629,Brazil - Country assistance evaluation : Brasil : Avaliacao da assistencia do Banco Mundial ao pais,"This Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) reviews key aspects of the Bank's program in Brazil, based on the central objective of the Bank's assistance to Brazil in the 1990s and early 2000: poverty alleviation. The strategy became more selective, focusing on the poor Northeast and on activities expected to address directly the roots of poverty. The growth element of the strategy supported the Government 's decentralization, and privatization of infrastructure through technical assistance, in regulation and selective lending, while assistance to the environment expanded significantly in the 1990s focused on green issues. At the end of the 1990s, the Bank shifted to adjustment lending to assist the Government in its stabilization and reform efforts. The Bank's assistance program to Brazil produced a sufficient mass of positive outcomes to be rated as satisfactory. The program contributed only modestly to the decline in income poverty rates - the gains resulted primarily from eliminating high inflation - and, the program contributed only indirectly, by helping the Government sustain stabilization at the end of the decade. However, the program contributed importantly to the impressive improvement in social indicators, and to the expanded access of the rural, and urban poor to basic infrastructure, and, the education gains will likely translate into reduced poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, in going forward, these gains will need to be enhanced for Brazil to achieve further reductions in poverty and inequality. Moreover, policies must maintain fiscal discipline to ensure access to external finance, keep inflation low, and prevent an erosion of the gains of the 1990s, including completing tax, social security, and financial sector reforms considered critical.",12-May-03,IEG Evaluation,[],"['Information Technology', 'Montreal Protocol', 'National Governance', 'Health Monitoring & Evaluation', 'Agricultural Extension']",IEG HD and Econ Mgmt Department (IEGHE),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/438261468769491704/pdf/276290BR.pdf

51419,Capacity building program in Burkina Faso,"Burkina Faso was one of the five poorest countries in the world during the late 1990s. The formation of local Rural Producer Organizations (RPOs) has been a positive step in empowering of the farming community, which can be expected to contribute to the development of the overall economy, given the importance of the country's agricultural sector. The RPO capacity-building program in Burkina Faso is part of the National Agricultural Services Development Project, phase two (PNDSA II), approved by the World Bank in 1997. The PNDSA II 'user funding' concept allows end users, such as RPOs, to apply funds disbursed for agricultural services according to their needs and priorities. After getting their subprojects approved by the national financial management unit (FMU), local RPOs can contract with their preferred agriculture service providers. Although the impact of RPOs at the grassroots is not yet clear, the interest generated by the programs since the two-year pilot has yielded positive outcomes. For example, over 200 subproject proposals by RPOs have been funded by the FMU and are being implemented. However, it has not been possible for the World Bank and the government to grant funds for all accepted proposals due to high number of proposals and administrative constraints.",1-Jan-03,Working Paper,"['Bhatnagar', 'Deepti', 'Rathore', 'Animesh', 'Moreno Torres', 'Magui', 'Kanungo', 'Parameeta']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",ECR Transition Unit (ECRTU),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/385661468005972104/pdf/514190WP0BR0Em142027B01PUBLIC102003.pdf

However, there was more to it than bringing the services closer to the farming community. It was also meant to strengthen the linkages among the various arms of the Ministry and provide a mechanism for delivering services in an integrated way to farmers and the public. The reform was conceived as part of an overall effort to place the farmer as the focal point of the Ministry's services and therefore, it was associated with proposals for advisory committees, management councils and the like. The Government, and the Minister of Food Production at the time placed strong emphasis on people's participation in development planning, and this was a strong element in the approach. Perhaps for the first time it was so forcefully and explicitly incorporated in policy statements in agriculture.

Decentralization is potentially important to agricultural knowledge and information systems, but decentralization is not an end in itself, and successful decentralization strategies must address three challenges-establishing a national framework for decentralization, developing subsector approaches, and enhancing capacities of various participants for co-production of decentralized goods and services. Agricultural extension services are under increasing pressure to become more effective, more responsive to clients, and less costly to government. Decentralization is an increasingly common aspect of extension reforms.

Since 1982, the training and visit (T&V) management system was adopted for extension services in the country, subject of debate on its perceived high costs, and apparent lack of impact on agricultural production, arguing its efficacy vs. alternative mechanisms for delivering extension advice. The evaluation in this report presents a theory based approach to systematically gather empirical evidence to establish the likely impact of the projects. Following a results-based management framework, the report relates the results in the field, to those of the projects' inputs. Intermediate output and outcome indicators are measured to assess the performance of the extension system, and confirm impact potentiality. The study concludes that it appears there has been no appreciable improvement in the effectiveness of extension services; institutional development is limited, thus, conducive to a continued weak management. This led to rationalize the extension services through alternative approaches. The report suggests recommendations on targeting practices for improved extension services, and develop information systems for better monitoring and evaluation results.

It provides guidelines and recommends steps to take during project preparation and implementation. 1) agricultural research investments should be evaluated at the level of research programs for important commodities or production systems. 2) agricultural extension investments are often best evaluated using rough measures of cost-effectiveness or unit costs. 3) alternatively, break-even analyses can be conducted for extension programs to show the minimum impact needed to justify proposed expenditures. 4) during project preparation, economic analyzes should focus on retrospective technology adoption and impact studies, and prospective technology case studies . 5) during project implementation, the emphasis should be on establishing systems that incorporate economic analysis on an ongoing basis into R&E evaluation, planning, and priority setting. 6) evaluators within the national agricultural research system should conduct the economic analyzes whenever possible to build local capacity and foster local ownership of the results. 7) all economic analyzes should use the economic surplus method or a simplification thereof, such as a cost-benefit analysis.",1-Mar-00,Departmental Working Paper,"['Alex', 'Gary E.', 'Byerlee', 'Derek R.', 'Horstkotte-Wesseler', 'Gesa', 'Maredia', 'Mywish Karimbhai']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security', 'Global Environment']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847071468148769638/pdf/208810DWP0REPL0Note0Exante0Analysis.pdf
33073,Village participation in rural development - Manual,"The approach this manual takes was originally developed to help agriculture extension and other rural development service agencies, better respond to the needs and demands of local people. Local farmers must be given greater control over the types of services, and technical information they receive from extension agents, and be given greater voice in the management of agricultural extension services. These are best achieved by using participatory approaches, such as participatory rural appraisal (PRA) used in natural resource management programs, participatory training in soil fertility management, tools related to project planning by objectives, and the like. Village participation is not new, but the question the manual seeks to answer is: how can participatory management be expanded to a national scale, in a relatively short period of time? This manual is intended to help practitioners at all levels work efficiently, and professionally with villagers as they assess their needs and undertake their development activities. The manual has four specific objectives: 1. Help practitioners conduct their field work more effectively; 2. Encourage practitioners to share information and experiences, leading to improvements in participatory tools and methods; 3. Offer technical support and guidance on methodologies to trainers; and, 4. Contribute to discussions on new developments and implementation of village participation on a large scale. The manual comprises three parts. Part one (chapters 1-6) presents the objectives and general principles of the participatory approach, discusses participatory methods, and provides details on the steps and tools appropriate to each stage of the process. To facilitate their use, the tools are also presented in individual worksheets, which form part of this manual. Part two (chapters 7-9) describes the underlying conditions necessary for successful implementation of the participatory approach, and, discusses the roles of the various actors involved. Part three (chapters 10-15) describes the conditions necessary for successful implementation of the participatory approach. It also describes what adoption of the approach means for organization of service delivery at the local, regional and national levels.",1-Jan-00,Publication,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'HIV AIDS', 'Hydrology', 'Cholera', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Leprosy', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",AFT: ESSD Front Office (AFTSD),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/759311468194042263/pdf/330730rev0Village0manual.pdf
22305,The voice of the farmer in agricultural extension - a review of beneficiary assessments of agricultural extrension and an inquiry into their potential as a management tool,"This paper reviews beneficiary assessments (BAs) (defined as an approach to information gathering, which assesses the value of an activity, as perceived by its principal users) of agricultural extension programs in Africa (Part I), and, examines the potential for institutionalizing this monitoring and evaluation approach, into Bank-supported agricultural extension projects (Part II). These beneficiary assessments were the first efforts in registering, in a systematic manner, the expressed reactions of the persons they served - the farmers - so as to improve the quality of their work. Agricultural extension programs were generally found to increase the rate of adoption among farmer-beneficiaries of the techniques put forward, moreover, demonstration plots were found to be the most effective way to induce changes in farmers' production practices. Major extensive service shortcomings were, from the farmers' perspective, identified as: lack of renewal of extension themes, with poor linkages between extension, and research; low coverage rate with poor diffusion via contact groups; and, lack of means to apply for either, seeds, fertilizer, insecticide, or credit. Nonetheless, Task Managers found BAs to be an extremely useful tool in making changes to projects, or in designing subsequent projects, and, the policy changes brought about by the findings of BAs were: increased attention to improving contact groups functions; need to go beyond communication with contact groups, i.e. using more participatory extension approaches; and, adapting extension to local needs, including increased institutional linkages.",18-Nov-99,Departmental Working Paper,"['Salmen', 'Lawrence F.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Disease Control & Prevention', 'Public Health Promotion', 'Educational Sciences', 'Gender and Development', 'Food Security']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776431468322742990/pdf/multi0page.pdf
19523,World Bank agricultural extension projects in Kenya - an impact evaluation,"This report evaluates the impact of World Bank supported projects for agricultural extension services in Kenya. Since 1982, the training and visit (T&V) management system was adopted for extension services in the country, subject of debate on its perceived high costs, and apparent lack of impact on agricultural production, arguing its efficacy vs. alternative mechanisms for delivering extension advice. The evaluation in this report presents a theory based approach to systematically gather empirical evidence to establish the likely impact of the projects. Following a results-based management framework, the report relates the results in the field, to those of the projects' inputs. Intermediate output and outcome indicators are measured to assess the performance of the extension system, and confirm impact potentiality. The study concludes that it appears there has been no appreciable improvement in the effectiveness of extension services; institutional development is limited, thus, conducive to a continued weak management. This led to rationalize the extension services through alternative approaches. The report suggests recommendations on targeting practices for improved extension services, and develop information systems for better monitoring and evaluation results. The intensity of visits should be replaced by wider coverage, through a more dynamic and responsive delivery system, focusing on empowering farmers.",30-Jun-99,IEG Evaluation,[],"['Agricultural Extension', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Inequality', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry']",Sector Evaluations (IEGSE),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503971468753347321/pdf/World-Bank-agricultural-extension-projects-in-Kenya-an-impact-evaluation.pdf

WPS2098,Reconsidering the evidence on returns to T&V extension in Kenya,"The authors revisit the widely disseminated results of a study (Bindlish and Evenson 1993, 1997) of the impact of the training and visit (T&V) system of management for public extension services in Kenya. T&V was introduced in Kenya by the World Bank and has since been supported through two successive projects. The impact of the projects continues to be the subject of much debate. The authors' paper suggests the need for greater vigilance in empirical analysis, especially about the quality of data used to support Bank policy and the need to validate potentially influential findings. Using household data from 1990, Bindlish and Evenson found the returns from extension to be very high. But the authors find that the returns estimated by Binslish and Evenson suffer from data errors, and limitations imposed by cross-sectional data. After correcting for several data processing and measurement errors, the authors show the results to be less robust than reported by Bindlish and Evenson and highly sensitive to regional effects. When region-specific effects are included, a positive return to extension cannot be established, using Bindlish and Evenson's data set and cross-sectional model specifications. After testing the robustness of results using a number of tests, the authors could not definitively establish the factors underlying strong regional effects, largely because of the limitations imposed by the cross-sectional framework. Household panel data methods would have allowed greater control for regional effects and would have yielded better insight into the impact of extension. The impact on agricultural productivity in Kenya expected from T&V extension services is not discernible from the available data, and the impact may vary across districts. The hypothesis that T&V had no impact in Kenya between 1982 and 1990 cannot be rejected. The sample data fail to support a positive rate of return on the investment in T&V.",30-Apr-99,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Gautam', 'Madhur', 'Anderson', 'Jack R.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry', 'Educational Sciences', 'Transport Services']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/300701468752115082/pdf/multi-page.pdf

Although the number of agricultural universities grew rapidly from 1960 to 1990, donor investment in these institutions is limited today. Universities have traditionally engaged in research, but less in agricultural extension, even though the contributions they can make to both are substantial. To establish effective AKISs, many agricultural universities must improve program relevance and links to clients. Today, agricultural universities face the challenges of providing relevant training for future agricultural scientists, defining institutional roles in relation to general universities, establishing structures and funding procedures for research and extension, drafting research agendas, providing adequate staff incentives, improving program relevance, and creating roles in extension.",6-Mar-99,Working Paper,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security']",Sector Evaluations (IEGSE),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/952431468320653662/pdf/319200Integrating1Univ.pdf

The five-day course in Washington was one of the key activities of the parent program, 'policy and institutional reform for sustainable rural development'. The Washington course will be followed by a series of distance education courses to be piloted in Africa in 1999. The objective of the Washington course was to help participants initiate and manage the process and the substance of policy and institutional reforms in the rural sector. By providing the latest thinking and good practices in rural development, the course aimed at helping participants in the following areas: 1) identifying key institutional issues; 2) diagnosing institutional problems; 3) formulating viable options; and 4) implementing effective institutional solutions to the problems. The course comprised four major components - the global and national context, the process and substance of policy and institutional reform, cross-cutting issues, and sub-sector issues. The sub-sector issues consisted of 11 specific topics that were presented in 4 parallel sessions organized in 2 afternoon periods. The course was attended by a total of 46 participants from 20 countries, representing senior policymakers and managers in developing countries and transition economies, as well as Bank staff, who are responsible for policy and institutional reforms in rural development.

31961,Summary of an agricultural education review : support for agricultural education in the World Bank and by other donors - past and present perspectives,"This Discussion Paper summarizes findings from the Agricultural Education Review. The full report of the review describes Bank, and other donor agricultural education and training (AET) projects, and components in some detail, and provides a baseline survey and resource material as a foundation for further work. The report also provides definitions of different levels of AET, the review methodology, and, an analysis of a range of issues arising from the survey. An introductory section provides the rationale for the review, noting the interactions between agricultural research, education, and extension, and analyzing the significance-for re-arranging funding, and provision of Agricultural Knowledge and Information System thematic Team / Research, education and extension - AKIS/REE services-of the global changes that have taken place over the past decade in the economic, political, governance, fiscal, and institutional landscape for rural sector activity. The review found that much was done and accomplished over the previous two, and more decades in terms of developing AET facilities, training AET faculty, and producing human resources. But during the past decade coinciding with the review period, the world and the environment for AET changed-dramatically. As a result, the approaches of the past that emphasized bricks and mortar, hardware, and overseas training for staff in the context of particular AET institutions, are now largely insufficient. On a positive note, the review however, found evidence of new thinking and policy work having occurred during the hiatus period, resulting in new guidelines for activity in Education generally, and at different levels, and in agricultural research and extension.",15-Oct-98,Working Paper,"['Maguire', 'Charles John', 'Willett', 'Anthony B.J.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Tertiary Education', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development']",Agriculture & Environmental Serv (AES),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/114951468327926791/pdf/319610rerv.pdf
57145,Improving soil fertility management in Sub-Saharan Africa,"There are more than 60 million smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Declining soil fertility is a fundamental impediment to agricultural growth and a major reason for slow growth in food production in SSA. In Africa, as a result of soil degradation, irrigated lands may be, on average, 7 percent below their potential productivity, rain-fed crop lands 14 percent below their potential and rangelands 45 percent below potential. Compared to parts of North America, Europe and of Asia, most SSA soils are naturally not very fertile. Low in a number of chemical constituents such as phosphorus, sulphur, magnesium and zinc, low amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) combined with poor land cover have resulted in poor soil structure, limited rooting depth and susceptibility to accelerated erosion. However, similar soils in other parts of the world have been made highly productive by using appropriate management techniques. There are two main approaches to improved soil fertility management. One is to attempt to meet plant requirements with purchased mineral fertilizers. The second relies on biological processes to optimize nutrient recycling, with little reliance on external chemical fertilizers, but maximizing the efficiency of their use. The more sustainable middle path borrows the best features from both and is referred to as Integrated Nutrition Management (INM). INM combines mineral fertilizers with organic resources, thus increasing fertilizer use efficiency, reducing the risks of acidification and providing a more balanced supply of nutrients.",1-Oct-98,Brief,"['Graeme Donovan', 'Frank Casey']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Fertilizers', 'Nutrition', 'Hydrology']",AFTOS: Dev.

WPS1931,The cost and performance of paid agricultural extension services : the case of agricultural technology transfer in Nicaragua,"Budgets for extension services have been reduced in many countries. One response to these reductions in public services in some countries has been to privatize extension services - with extension services provided for a fee, by either public agencies or private companies. Under the new approach, producers become clients instead of beneficiaries. The authors examine ways to measure the cost of providing paid-extension services and its performance and apply these indicators to data on Nicaragua, where paid extension has existed for several years. Data were insufficient to compare the quality of privately and publicly provided extension services, but available data suggest that the costs of extension have declined over time. Results suggest that paid extension is feasible and has a positive impact, even in a relatively poor country such as Nicaragua. The national system for agricultural technology-transfer services was redesigned to include three main modules: mass media and free demonstrations; cofinanced extension services; and private extension services. The relatively high cost recovery rates in Nicaragua and the economic performance of the two paid programs show that even poor farmers are willing to pay for a service that improves their economic efficiency and ability to earn a living. To the surprise of everyone involved, Nicaragua's producer clients understood that without cost-sharing, the system would not endure.",30-Jun-98,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Dinar', 'Ariel', 'Keynan', 'Gabriel']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Transport Services', 'Crime and Society']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/800061468779679086/pdf/multi-page.pdf
31921,Making competitive grants programs of the national agricultural research systems work : learning from the Brazilian experience,"In the last few years there has been increasing interest in establishing competitive grants programs in agricultural research in developing countries. In donor funded projects, these programs are often seen as a complement to the ongoing research programs, undertaken through regular long term research funding, but which often pose the risk of being viewed as a panacea, and a substitute for regular long term research funding. Their design and implementation needs to reflect understanding of a complexity of factors needed to make them work effectively. The design of Brazil's competitive grants program in agriculture is drawing extensively on international and domestic experience. This paper briefly reviews the recent Brazilian experience, and offers its full operational manual for review, and possible wider adaptation as appropriate in other countries. The competitive system established and implemented by EMBRAPA (Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária) actively seeks to increase competitiveness, and partnerships among participating institutions. Access to grant funding by the entire national agricultural research system, through the process of a competitive system, will enhance the quality of project proposals, and support the improvement of research results and better linkages of research to felt demands. Through partnerships, the Brazil Agricultural Technology Development Project expects to capitalize on the complementarity of Brazilian researchers with those at the global level, and their corresponding institutions.

57129,West Africa : community based natural resource management,"This has to be accomplished against a background of high illiteracy rates, rapidly growing populations, low and erratic rainfall, inherently infertile soils, and development strategies which have had a strong urban bias. Under such conditions, traditional production systems are unable to sustain the population. Without significant change, land degradation will accelerate and the natural resource base on which agricultural production depends will continue to decline. The efforts made in the 1970s and 1980s to tackle this problem were not particularly successful. They tended to focus too much on production and did not attempt to involve the local population in decision-making and management. Drawing on the lessons learned from these projects, governments, and donors initiated a new generation of community-based, decentralized, multi sectoral Natural Resource Management (NRM) projects. Starting as a series of pilot operations in the late 1980s, this approach sought to ensure local community participation in the identification development and implementation of NRM projects, while building institutional capacity for effective resource use planning and human resource development.",1-Mar-98,Brief,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Natural Resources Management', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Disease Control & Prevention', 'Hydrology', 'Natural Resources Management and Rural Issues', 'Global Environment']",AFTOS: Dev.

Evidence from Kenya and Burkina Faso shows that T&V management enhance the effectiveness of extension and that such programs support agricultural growth and produce high returns on investments. The data indicate that areas served by extension have higher yields and that within these areas the highest yields are achieved by farmers who participate directly in extension activities. As a result, extension helps to close the gap between die yields attainable with existing technologies and those actually realized by farmers.

The principal mechanism was a contribution by the fanner paid as a bonus to the extensionist: the aim was to introduce incentives for providers to improve the service through rewards linked to the quality of their work and to establish direct accountability of extensionist to client. The outcomes showed that the co-financing concept can be successful. The article describes the design, implementation, and results in the expectation that the lessons learned may be of interest elsewhere.",1-Aug-97,Journal Article,"['Keynan', 'Gabriel', 'Olln', 'Manuel', 'Dinar', 'Ariel']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Coastal and Marine Resources', 'Food Security', 'Energy and Natural Resources', 'Global Environment']",Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481711468097455532/pdf/766030JRN0WBRO00Box374378B00PUBLIC0.pdf
16851,Agricultural extension and research : achievements and problems in national systems,"This report reviews the World Bank's experience in supporting the development of national agricultural research and extension systems in developing countries in the early 1980s and 1990s, and makes recommendations for future support. The review covers all of the Bank's operational regions, excepting East and Central Asia (represented by Turkey only). It concludes that Bank interventions have had a significant positive impact, but also maintains that serious deficiencies persist in most of the supported national systems. Better planning and appropriate guidance during implementation could have reduced many of these problems. Of particular concern is the sustainability of institutions and systems developed under Bank projects. Future projects must be more cognizant of the circumstances of each country in supporting a particular scale and mode of operation, since these projects are essentially institution building and long-term investments. Public spending on research and extension services and on external support of implementing institutions needs to continue, but fiscal resources need to be used more efficiently.",30-Jun-97,Publication,"['Purcell', 'Dennis L.', 'Anderson', 'Jock R.']","['Agricultural Research', 'Food Security', 'Nutrition', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Rural Settlements']","Director-General, Evaluation (IEGDG)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/539111468741364112/pdf/Agricultural-extension-and-research-achievements-and-problems-in-national-systems.pdf
IDP168,Institutional development impact study,"This report attempts to determine the causes behind the South Asia region's (SAS) poor relative performance in the achievement of institutional development objectives. The first portion of the analysis recalculates institutional development ratings by redefining OED's evaluation criteria. In this way, it is possible to decipher whether SAS's absolute performance level and relative ranking are ""artifactual"" or real. The second part of this investigation looks at projects which have performed well overall, but which have achieved negligible institutional development to determine the causes behind the inconsistent results. The final section of the analysis pairs projects with extremely good and extremely poor performance based on country and sector. Such a pairing facilitates an understanding of why, within particular sectors of particular countries and within a particular time frame, one project will perform well while another will perform poorly. By this, the characteristics common to more successful and less successful projects can be identified.

The extension needs of men and women differ. Women need direct extension on the crops and livestock they grow or have responsibility for.

As patterns of production change and men migrate in search of work, the labor input of women is increasing. Yet only about one participant in five in extension activities in the region is a woman. In all the Sahelian countries, the agricultural service projects funded by the International Development Association (IDA) focused initially on establishing national programs based on Training and Visit (T&V) management principles.

WPS1475,Decentralization : the way forward for rural development,"Special strategies are needed to address the widespread incidence of rural poverty in developing countries, but initiatives aimed at improving the rural standard of living have not consistently reduced poverty. The author examines the rationale for a specific rural focus in poverty reduction programs and reviews recent attempts to encourage rural development. He discusses the role decentralization could play in rural development programs and analyzes recent efforts to implement decentralized rural development programs. The author concludes that although decentralization initiatives have a long history, much more needs to be understood about various components of decentralization before sound advice can be given to policymakers. He suggests a conceptual model - based on a ""souffle"" theory of decentralization - that incorporates the essential elements of political, fiscal, and institutional decentralization as they related to rural development outcomes. Like a souffle that requires just the right combination of milk, eggs, and heat to rise, a successful program of decentralization must include just the right combination of political, fiscal, and institutional elements to improve rural development outcomes.",30-Jun-95,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Parker', 'Andrew N.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Macro-Fiscal Policy', 'Taxation & Subsidies', 'Economic Adjustment and Lending', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Public Sector Economics', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Public Finance Decentralization and\n            Poverty Reduction', 'Inequality']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/282091468766807862/pdf/multi-page.pdf

WTP247,Agricultural extension : a step beyond the next step,"Governments often lack a clear strategy for extension. It is now recognized that in most cases, a single extension system may not be the only option. Rather, there is a need for flexibility and the adoption of multiple approaches to extension. This is increasingly being considered within the Bank, recommended to Borrowers and tested in the field. Another key point made in the paper is that extension must evolve rapidly if it is to survive. Extension services continue to be provided in most countries by the public sector while farmers play a rather passive uncommitted role. Given the high recurrent costs involved, this situation cannot be sustained for long. Sooner or later, countries will have to divest themselves from extension services and the supply of agricultural inputs. When this happens, most responsibilities for extension should gradually and to the extent possible, be handed over to the private sector. Meanwhile, the public sector is likely to retain a certain role in agricultural extension, a role that needs to be redefined.",31-Jul-94,Publication,"['Ameur', 'Charles']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'State Owned Enterprise Reform', 'Public Sector Administrative & Civil\n            Service Reform', 'Hydrology', 'Food Security', 'Privatization', 'Energy Privatization', 'Democratic Government', 'Economics and Finance of Public\n            Institution Development', 'Public Sector Administrative and Civil\n            Service Reform', 'De Facto Governments']",Middle East & No Africa Regn Off (MNA),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/287731467993229253/pdf/WTP2470PUB0FRE0Pas0de0Plus000french.pdf

12429,Agricultural sector review,"This review was prepared in response to growing concern in the World Bank about the decline in volume and performance of lending for agriculture. The review points out that agriculture is indeed a problematic sector in which success is more elusive than in other sectors, but argues that the critical role the sector can play for the sustained alleviation of poverty justifies continued attention by the Bank. In addition, the prospects for agricultural development are increasingly brighter, and many important lessons have been learned about the ingredients of sustainably successful agricultural development. Agriculture is particularly vulnerable to poor macroeconomic management. However, as more countries adopt structural adjustment to improve their macroeconomic management, the prospects for agricultural development are brighter. Provided the sequencing of reforms is well thought out, in almost all cases structural adjustment programs will make agriculture more profitable. Agriculture has also suffered in many countries from poor sectoral policies and massive public intervention in commercial activities. Again, as more countries adopt sectoral adjustment to improve sectoral management, and provided safeguards are taken against substitution by private for public monopolies, sectoral adjustment programs will make agriculture more efficient. Prospects for agricultural development will also improve with trade liberalization. The outcome of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations is still uncertain, but the potential gains for developing countries' agriculture are in the tens of billions of dollars per year. Meanwhile, encouraging steps are being taken towards regional trade liberalization in North America and in the southern cone of South America. Lessons on the conditions for success have been learned from operations evaluation work on nearly 900 completed projects over 20 years. The lessons are of three kinds: what not to do; what to do; and, where the evidence is inconclusive, what to test. This review contains ample illustrations of each kind.",31-Jul-93,Working Paper,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Nutrition', 'International Trade and Trade Rules', 'Food Security', 'Inequality']",Environ & Soc Sustainable Dev VP (ESD),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/753181492798600271/pdf/multi-page.pdf

Yet policy gridlock and stop-and-go implementation have been associated with excessive responsiveness to interest groups. This paper aims to pull together seemingly disparate strands of development thinking and experience. After debunking some popular myths, the development antecedents of participation are identified and a definition of participation is offered. Next, a stylized theory is presented at the micro level. Some implications are then drawn for organizational design and for development policy planning. The focus on participatory development signifies an opening of development economics to disciplines other than macroeconomics. In particular, microeconomics and business administration must join forces under the umbrella of institutional economics, political economists, and development practice should be shaped by all the social science disciplines.",31-Jul-92,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Picciotto', 'Robert']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Economic Theory & Research', 'Social Analysis', 'Quality of Life & Leisure', 'National Governance', 'Government Policies', 'Industrial Economics', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Hydrology', 'Youth and Governance', 'Economic Growth']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690921468766804456/pdf/multi0page.pdf

Extension programs can increase agricultural productivity and rural incomes by bridging the gap between new technical knowledge and a farmer's practices, but research and extension services usually assume that farmers are men. In fact, women play a critical role in a wide range of agricultural activities, and as men move into off-farm employment, women's importance to agriculture is growing. The specific needs and problems of women farmers must be addressed in the design and implementation of agricultural projects.

WPS627,The role of institutions in poverty reduction : a focus on the productive sectors,"The author of this paper contends that institutional development (ID) is critical to growth and sustainable poverty reduction. Although there is no single model for poverty-oriented institutional development, and ID initiatives vary considerably across sectors and nations, important common lessons have been learned about successful institutional development initiatives. The author presents these in terms of six components: (a) forming and strengthening local organizations; (b) supporting institutional pluralism; (c) building links between poverty-oriented institutions; (d) adopting the appropriate organizational structure and encouraging strong leadership; (e) adopting the learning process approach; and (f) mobilizing local resources and the participation of poor people. Both successful and unsuccessful programs are used to illustrate the importance of these components. Institutional investments often require unconventional, potentially costly programs and projects. ID initiatives have been criticized in terms of the costs and benefits of different approaches, the scale on which they can operate, their compatibility with conventional project frameworks, the degree and types of decentralization they require, and their political feasibility. Using case studies from different productive sectors and subsectors, the author illustrates how these objections may be unwarranted and that investments in institutional development can be both economically and politically viable.",31-Mar-91,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Holt', 'Sharon L.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/519851468764401909/pdf/multi0page.pdf

WPS403,Innovative agricultural extension for women : a case study in Cameroon,"Agricultural extension has not been particularly kind to Africa's women farmers. On a continent where women produce 90 percent of the food and 60 percent of total agricultural output, insensitivity and neglect by extension services is the norm. Numerous case studies have pointed out the ""gender gap"" that exists in the provision of extension services to women farmers. Compared to male farmers or farming couples, women farmers receive far less attention from extension services, thus benefiting less from improved farming techniques. However, in Cameroon's North West province, over the last five years, the Mission de Developpement de la Province du Nord-Ouest (MIDENO), has been implementing a project to improve agricultural production in the province. In terms of agricultural extension, the project has hired almost 200 new extension agents, one-fourth of whom are women. The overall representation of women in the extension service is now 18.3 percent, among the highest in developing countries. The paper is organized into three Chapters : Chapter I deals with the agricultural and policy setting in which MIDENO was designed; Chapter II is devoted to the MIDENO case study; Chapter III attempts to generalize from the MIDENO case and determines the extent to which the MIDENO's experience and success can be sustained and replicated.",30-Jun-90,Policy Research Working Paper,"['Walker', 'S.

Introducing aggregate nonconvexities also has different implications for policy on debt overhangs. In particular, the model allows for rational relending by creditors.

The book further explains the data collection and analysis techniques referred to in the companion volume. It is selective; it does not provide comprehensive coverage of all methods. Furthermore, for those methods it does cover, the book advocates simplicity and economy. It emphasizes qualitative interviewing methods because most monitoring and evaluation efforts will need to use them for limited, non-random coverage of respondents. Examples of sample theory and sample selection, conversely, are mainly in terms of rates of adoption and similar indicators. In a similar vein, the book advocates greater reliance on farmer estimates when discussing crop production and yield, because the issue of concern in this context is project beneficiary responses rather than aggregate national or regional estimates.

Previous reviews have examined the functions performed by the New Delhi office and suggested modifications in the light of the changing needs and emphasis of our program in India and the relationship between the Bank and the government. This review has taken the office as it evolved in the course of time and focused on those further modifications which would now seem necessary in the light of the reorganization and the organizational changes which have taken place. The role of the office is undergoing changes. The office will be functioning more as an extension of the country department at headquarters and will be closer integrated in the departmental work program. Further improvements in communications through the introduction of electronic links should assist in this process. The work program for the office will be planned and monitored by the divisional managers and the lead economist in the country department. This will be reflected in the reporting arrangements and in the arrangements for the staff performance plans and performance reviews.,21-Dec-87,Working Paper,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Health Care Services Industry', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Telecommunications Infrastructure', 'Food Security']",Policy and Operations (SECPO),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/613931468258291719/pdf/768360WP0some000Box374391B00PUBLIC0.pdf
ARU58,"Population density, market access and farmer-generated technical change in sub-Saharan Africa","Just as technical change in agriculture in the industrialized countries results from the economy's land and labor endowments and by the conditions of demand, so too is farmer-generated technical change in sub - Saharan Africa influenced by the economy's population, land endowments and market infrastructure. This paper provides empirical support to Boserup's thesis on population induced technical change in traditional agricultural societies. The discussion concentrates on several effects from her thesis of population growth and its consequences on farming systems. The effects concentrated on are (i) the increasing intensity of land use; (ii) increasing investments in land improvements; (iii) the encouragement of animal traction in cultivation; (iv) maintenance of soil fertility; and (v) changes from general to specific land rights. The first four of these effects result from the necessity to raise land productivity and to offset the increase in labor requirements associated with more intensive cultivation. The final effect on the transition to specific land rights provides incentives to undertake investments in specific plots, investments which are required for the intensification of production and the preservation of soil fertility.",30-Sep-86,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Pinghali', 'Prabhu L', 'Binswanger', 'Hans P']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Economics', 'Labor Markets', 'Food Security']",Off. of Regional Vice President (AFRVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/356041468210859501/pdf/ARU58000Popula0n0sub0Saharan0Africa.pdf

The world economy is entering its fourth year of growth since the recession of 1982. Yet the recovery is hesitant with many developing countries facing serious problems of adjustment. The recent decline in oil prices, interest rates, and inflation will provide a stimulus to develop and developing countries alike. But many debtor countries, particularly oil exporters, will find it hard to maintain growth in the near term. The effects of the recovery have been much weaker for many low-income Sub-Saharan countries. An examination of the policy options in developing countries suggests that economic stability and growth could be greatly enhanced by focusing on improved pricing and trade policies.",8-Jul-86,Annual Report,[],"['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Research', 'Nutrition', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/248291468763792062/pdf/3478510french.pdf
ARU33,An economic appraisal of withdrawing fertilizer subsidies in India,"Owing to the importance of fertilizers in increasing agricultural output, government intervention in the fertilizer market to encourage its more widespread production and use has been a common phenomenon in many developing countries. However, with government intervention, certain questions arise. The government must not only choose between alternative forms of intervention, but it must also make comparisons of alternative uses of scarce public funds in order to justify the cost of the intervention itself. This paper is concerned with what the optimal form of intervention in the fertilizer market ought to be. Instead, this paper considers the economic costs and returns of alternative uses of public funds already earmarked for a fertilizer subsidy. In particular, it looks at the current fertilizer subsidies in India. It uses a general equilibrium model of India's agricultural sector to simulate the likely consequences of its removal on agricultural performance and the overall distribution of income. The model is also used to determine the net effects of reallocating fertilizer subsidies to finance other government sponsored agricultural programs instead of expanding irrigation and increasing foodgrain imports.",1-Aug-85,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Quizon', 'Jaime']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'E-Government', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Economics', 'E-Government', 'Public Sector Administrative & Civil\n            Service Reform', 'Educational Sciences', 'E-Government', 'Democratic Government', 'Economics and Finance of Public\n            Institution Development', 'Public Sector Administrative and Civil\n            Service Reform', 'De Facto Governments']",SAS,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/180341468253188752/pdf/ARU33.pdf

The paper does not, therefore, specifically address issues that arise in evaluating the contribution of an established system of extension to agricultural output.

ARU42,"Education, experience and imperfect processing of information in the adoption of innovations","Education, experience and the processing of information play key roles in a decision maker's choice of adopting various innovations. Before a decision maker decides whether or not to adopt a new production technique, he must necessarily learn of its existence and have some idea of its properties. In particular, a risk-neutral decision-maker will be unlikely to adopt the technique unless he believes that its profitability exceeds that of the existing technique. In the literature on the adoption of innovations, it is known that both education and experience are important determinants of adoption speed. In fact, the paper argues that among decision-makers with the same prior beliefs and faced with the same additional information, those who have more education and/or experience should be more efficient information processors because they are prone to make less-serious mistakes in processing the information. The paper further develops a business decision model to more completely measure information processors' attitudes and thinking in regard to adopting innovations.",30-Jun-85,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Fischer', 'Alastair']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security']",DEC,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/830101468173933472/pdf/ARU42000Educat0ption0of0innovations.pdf
ARU46,The impact of agricultural extension : the training and visit system in India,"The T & V extension system, designed to overcome some of the major problems afflicting earlier forms of extension services, has often been criticized itself. Its critics have claimed that not only is the T & V system expensive, it is also ineffective and biased towards wealthier farmers. In an attempt to obtain empirical information to devaluate the T & V system, this paper uses farm survey data from India to examine the effectiveness of T & V extension. In this paper, the authors compare the relative importance of various information sources provided to farmers on new farming practices. They also examine the choice of contact farmers, relative frequency with which contact and noncontact farmers are reached by extension, T & V impact on farmers' knowledge along with farm productivity and finally a cost/benefit analysis on the T & V system. The results show that even with the added costs incurred by the implementation of the T & V system, the benefits resulting from it are even higher both to farmers and farm yields.",30-Jun-85,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Feder', 'Gershon', 'Slade', 'Roger']","['Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Fertilizers', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Nutrition', 'Agricultural Research', 'Food Security']",South Asia Sector Units (SAS),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/252851468914056912/pdf/The-impact-of-agricultural-extension-the-training-and-visit-system-in-India.pdf

The unreliability of the data throws into question the utility of careful economic analyses of irrigation projects. More importantly, it means that in the case of large surface-flow schemes canal officials cannot manage the system in the absence of reliable information about the systems output; they can only administer the inputs.

ARU34,"The impact of agricultural extension : a case study of the training and visit system (T & V) in Haryana, India","The paper presents results from a study designed to estimate the effect on agricultural productivity of the Training and Visit Extension System in the Karnal and Kairana Tehsil districts in India. The farm level data show that in Karnal under the T & V system, the extent of farmer interaction with extension agents was greater than in Kairana and that farmers in Karnal viewed the change in the extension system favorably. Moreover, an examination of the rates of knowledge diffusion for a select set of practices for High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of rice and wheat suggests that T & V extension led to a noticeable increase in the rate of knowledge diffusion of several HYV wheat practices. The main thrust of the paper, however, is an analysis of productivity differentials between the two areas for two crops, HYV wheat and rice, and the extent to which any estimated differences can be attributed to the introduction of the T & V extension system. After making adjustments to derive a baseline differential that was consistent with the evidence derived from the detailed farm sample survey undertaken, the final results show that, after three years of T & V extension, there was a gain in productivity for HYV wheat of about 6-7 percent which can be attributed to T & V extension.",31-May-85,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Feder', 'Gershon', 'Lau', 'Lawrence', 'Slade', 'Roger']","['Hydrology', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Fertilizers', 'Food Security']",South Asia Sector Units (SAS),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/117291468913913860/pdf/The-impact-of-agricultural-extension-a-case-study-of-the-training-and-visit-system-T-V-in-Haryana-India.pdf
ARU32,On the provision of extension services in Third World agriculture,"Extension services in agriculture aim to assist the spread of innovations throughout the region in which they operate. An important issue in deciding how to make such services more cost-effective is to determine on which farmers or groups of farmers the extension services should concentrate their efforts. This paper examines one of the dimensions which may be of importance in this decision: the size of the farm. Both empirical (Rogers, 1983) and theoretical studies (Feder et al, 1985) suggest that larger farmers adopt more quickly. If these were the only considerations, the optimal strategy for the extension service would be to concentrate largely or solely on the largest farmers. Such a strategy, however, ignores three things: (a) that there are other determinants of speed of adoption that size of farm, so that some small farmers and not all large farmers will be early adopters; (b) that there are undesirable distributional effects of concentrating development efforts towards those who are relatively rich; and (c) the manner in which extension advice is spread throughout a population of farmers. The factors (a), (b) and (c) above are all reasons why the optimal extension strategy should be to concentrate less-exclusively on the largest farmers.",31-Jan-85,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Fischer', 'A.', 'AGR']","['Food Security', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Public Health Promotion', 'Energy and Mining', 'Energy and Environment', 'Energy Demand']",VP Dev Econ & Chief Economist (DEC),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/831661468913732029/pdf/On-the-provision-of-extension-services-in-Third-World-agriculture.pdf
ARU25,The training and visit extension system : an analysis of operations and effects,"The paper analyzes several aspects of the operation and effects of the T&V extension system. Specific questions related to the supply of, and demand for, extension agents (VEW) visits, the presence or absence of farm size bias in VEW visits, seasonal and longer-term variations in the pattern of VEW visits, the relative importance of the VEW as a source of information to farmers, and the crop yields obtained by farmers in relation to their main sources of agricultural advice are addressed in detail. The paper draws the following main conclusions. Most (85 percent) contact farmers are visited regularly, and the majority of noncontact farmers also have some interaction with VEWs, suggesting that the supply of extension services is adequate. VEWs appear to be more active in the dry season than in the rainy season, which may be attributable to an emphasis on irrigated crop technology. As experience with the T&V system increases, contact farmers appear to receive fewer visits from VEWs, but visits to noncontact farmers increase. VEWs play a more important role as disseminators of information in areas operating the T&V system than in areas relying on the older community development system of extension.",30-Nov-84,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Feder', 'Gershon', 'Slade', 'Roger', 'Sundaram', 'A.']","['Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Water and Food Supply', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Food Security', 'Nutrition', 'Agricultural Research']",South Asia Sector Units (SAS),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/331201468914112539/pdf/The-training-and-visit-extension-system-an-analysis-of-operations-and-effects.pdf
ARU26,The role of public policy in the diffusion of new agricultural technology,"The generation of new technology is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for increased farm productivity with given natural resources. In the short-run, it is not even a necessary condition, if there is a gap between available knowledge and typical farmer practices. A crucial element in the process linking the generation of new technology to increased farm productivity is the diffusion of the new knowledge among its potential users, the farmers. The other element in this process is the actual adoption of the new technology, or parts of it, by the farmers. The present paper considers both knowledge diffusion and adoption, assuming that a relevant and viable new technology is available. The focus is on the rationale for and scope of public sector involvement in these processes. Such involvement includes publicly sponsored information dissemination, intervention in output and input markets, intervention in the credit market and investment in infrastructure.",31-Oct-84,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Feder', 'G.', 'Slade', 'R.', 'AGR']","['Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Food Security', 'Primary Education']",VP Dev Econ & Chief Economist (DEC),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/169521468913771686/pdf/The-role-of-public-policy-in-the-diffusion-of-new-agricultural-technology.pdf

One district is covered by the T & V system, while the other is covered by an earlier system. The data show a significantly higher level of village-level extension activity in the area covered by T & V, which is compatible with the larger number of staff and higher expenditure under this system. Among specific findings are: (i) contact farmers under T & V, although not fully representative, are valuable as opinion leaders; (ii) extension exposure is much wider under T & V; (iii) the T & V system is perceived to be an improvement; (iv) rates of knowledge diffusion are faster under T & V; and (v) there is no evidence that the T & V system is biased in favor of the wealthiest farmers.

A major channel for the dissemination of information on these technologies is the agricultural extension system. This paper discusses some aspects of the interaction between extension agents and farmers within the Training and Visit system (T&V).

For the particular region studied, the analysis shows that contact farmers manifest several characteristics which are commonly hypothesized to indicate the propensity to lead opinion and a potential receptiveness to innovations. These farmers are not representative of the community in many respects, tending to be wealthier, more educated, and of higher status. But in other respects, such as caste and access to irrigation, they are fairly representative of the general population. Effectiveness of T&V is highly dependent upon the regularity with which extension agents visit the contact farmers. The agents tend to achieve a high degree of regularity, and also interact to a surprising degree with non-contact farmers.

Although the cognitive achievement of the pupils enrolled in the 10 experimental classes have not been systematically measured and compared to other classes, the most likely result is that these pupils at least do as well as other Senegalese pupils. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that these results will give a strong support for the expansion of the system in Senegal, which would generate a 7 percent increase in the cost of primary education, at a time of severe budgetary constraints and of rapidly increasing demand for primary education. The Senegalese pilot project shows that the Western African context does not allow a low cost development of such technologies at the present time. Radio seems a more suitable educational support than television, given the technological and financial conditions.",31-Aug-81,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Orivel', 'F.', 'DEDPH']","['Telecommunications Infrastructure', 'Climate Change and Environment', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Disease Control & Prevention', 'Water Resources Assessment']",VP Dev Econ & Chief Economist (DEC),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/387491468760564625/pdf/La-télévision-scolaire-du-Sénégal-évaluation-économique-et-perspectives.pdf
UNN88,Agricultural extension in India,"This paper provides a brief historical background of the evolution of extension services in India. It highlights the need for an effective extension system and provides a short, but comprehensive picture of the achievements of the Training and Visit System over the past five years. Thereafter, the paper devotes a section to problems encountered in introducing the system and assesses prospects for future development. The paper concludes with a suggested work program for future Bank involvement, together with government agencies in India. It also notes those areas where particular attention needs to be paid in the years ahead.",31-Aug-81,Working Paper,"['SAS', 'AGR']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Natural Disasters']",South Asia Regional Office (SAR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/689291513182890105/pdf/UNN88000Agricultural0extension0in0India.pdf
DPH8120,The impact of agricultural extension services : a review of the literature,"This paper provides a review of the literature on the effectiveness of agricultural extension services worldwide. It shows that evaluators of the internal effectiveness of extension services are generally critical; they claim that extension services have poor performance, reach only a small proportion of farmers, have wrong objectives, and are of little help to the agricultural sector as a whole. The author argues that this diagnosis may be excessive, that evaluators often have irrelevant evaluation criteria, and that historically the situation has substantially improved. Evaluators of external efficiency, mainly economists, show much more positive results. Those who use aggregate data find high social rates of return to investment in extension services and high correlations between extension services and agricultural productivity, but the methods used tend to overestimate the specific impact of extension services. Those who use farm-level data obtain mixed results, about half with significantly positive regression coefficients but of low value, and the other half with nonsignificant regression coefficients.",1-Jul-81,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Orivel', 'Francois']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Educational Sciences', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Transport Services']",VP Dev Econ & Chief Economist (DEC),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448181468141578794/pdf/DPH8120010french.pdf
SWP458,Comparative study of the management and organization of irrigation projects,"This paper is primarily concerned with development of an analytical framework for the monitoring and evaluation of irrigation project management in developing countries. It is based on an extensive review of the English language literature on the subject, and four field studies in South and East Asia. The central part of the report consists of a series of detailed arguments to explain and justify the particular evaluation framework prepared. A principal focus is the performance of the activity of water distribution since it is peculiar to irrigated agriculture. Special attention is given to identifying and recommending those organizational structures and management procedures which appear most likely to serve the interests of the rural poor, particularly small farmers and those at the tail-end of irrigation systems. The study concludes that there are immense opportunities for improvements in the performance of irrigation projects through management reform and better water distribution. Appendix A summarizes guidelines for analysis in a checklist format. Recommendations for further evaluation and follow-up action are given.",31-May-81,Staff Working Paper,"['BOTTRALL', 'A.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Water and Food Supply', 'Hydrology', 'Food Security']",Development Economics and Chief Economist,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/613981468767055677/pdf/multi-page.pdf
REP196,Sociological dimensions of extension organization : the introduction of the T & V system in India,"Probably the most significant progress in agricultural extension worldwide in the 1970s has been the development of the Training and Visits Extension System. However, this development has not yet captured the attention of many social scientists. This article, using India as a case study, describes the structure of the Training and Visits system, its organizational principles, its departures from other extension arrangements, and its sociological implications.",31-Jan-81,Journal Article,"['CERNEA', 'M.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Educational Sciences', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",SAR,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/990341468258850226/pdf/REP196000Socio0000V0system0in0India.pdf

SER47,Small farmers and the landless in South Asia : prospects and problems,"The extent to which small farmer productivity increases are possible, the constraints placed on such productivity increases by institutional factors, and employment and income opportunities in South Asia are discussed. The availability of abundant family labor and the scarcity of cash among small farmers suggest that initial efforts should concentrate on labor intensive and cash saving methods of raising small farmer productivity. Institutional constraints that hinder small farm productivity are associated with problems of access to factor and product markets. These access problems involve credit, markets, extension, research, and education. Nonfarm and noncrop activities will continue to be a primary source of employment and earnings for landless, near landless, and marginal farmers. There are two sources for such employment growth: on-farm demand for wage labor and nonfarm employment in processing, fisheries, forestry, marketing, transportation, distribution, and services in rural areas. Numerous references.",31-Aug-78,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['SINGH', 'I.']","['Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Rural Settlements', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Inequality', 'Hydrology']",South Asia Regional Office (SAR),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686741468915304606/pdf/Small-farmers-and-the-landless-in-South-Asia-prospects-and-problems.pdf
SWP272,A system for monitoring and evaluating agricultural extension projects,"The proposed system is designed as a management tool to ensure that the extension organization is operating efficiently, to enable management to take corrective action when necessary and to provide policy makers with appropriate information. The recommended system consists of a conceptual framework, a set of indicators for monitoring project implementation, a set of indicators for estimating impact on farmers, and the design of a data generation system consisting of a set of sample surveys and ad hoc studies which would produce information concerning the accepted indicators. Recommendations for the organization, structure and staffing of a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit are included and an implementation time table is suggested. Detailed specifications were prepared describing sample allocations, recommended sampling procedures, draft questionnaires and appropriate data collection and processing techniques.",31-Dec-77,Staff Working Paper,"['CERNEA', 'M.', 'TEPPING', 'B.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Fertilizers', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",VP Dev Econ & Chief Economist (DEC),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/813081468765006764/pdf/multi0page.pdf
AGP3,Kenya - Prices and subsidies case study (Vol. 2),"This analysis of Kenya's agricultural sector presents findings on: (i) the comparative advantage among crops, assuming that export demand for the major commodities is perfectly elastic; (ii) the size of farms and productivity; and (iii) incentives and farmer response, the most important of which relates to the matter of incentives to improve crop quality. Kenya appears to have reached a certain degree of market maturity and sophistication to warrant a slow but steady movement toward deregulation of the price structure of maize, meat, and other agricultural commodities. Distribution of land to small farmers should continue, with care not to misallocate resources. In addition, provision of well-organized, efficient cooperative societies would strengthen the small farmer. Administrative efficiency and marketing ability of the various Boards need improvement. If prices are allowed to approach their border parity, no direct subsidy would be necessary for farmers to survive and do well. The government should provide the necessary social and economic infrastructure to rural areas. The meat industry could be strengthened. Kenya possesses fine agricultural resources, but greater priority must be given the sector if it is to fully exploit its potential.",1-Jun-77,Working Paper (Numbered Series),"['Peter McLoughlin Assoc.

SWP195,African experiences with rural development : a digest report on the African rural development study,"The results of the African experience with rural development are presented as obtained in studies of 12 countries. Four broad types of projects were reviewed: 1) commodity or export crop programs; 2) integrated development programs; 3) functional programs to remove single, critical obstacles to development; and 4) subsectoral programs to stimulate development of wide geographical areas by the delivery of basic services. Despite a diversity of immediate objectives and of methods for achieving them, the projects all have brought about increases in productivity and have raised aggregate income levels within their target areas, although with varying degrees of success and with varying degrees of equity. Rural development programs of this type must be viewed as part of a continuous, dynamic process, and emphasis on mass participation also means that a sequential approach may frequently be necessary in planning and implementing a strategy. Using this approach, suggestions are made for specific areas of improvement in the areas of agricultural services, land use planning, data gathering, phased planning in implementation of public services, manpower training, technical assistance, and administration.",1-Jan-75,Staff Working Paper,"['WEAVING', 'R.']","['Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Rural Settlements', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Food Security', 'Agricultural Growth and Rural Development', 'Inequality']",Office of the Regional Vice Pres (AFRVP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/679301468740157281/pdf/SWP1950with0text.pdf
