P180732,Accessible Agricultural Financing,Ukraine Agriculture Recovery Inclusive Support Emergency (ARISE) Project,"This use case example reflects a strategic implementation of accessible financial support mechanisms to bolster agricultural productivity in the face of adversity. In the context of the Ukraine Agriculture Recovery Inclusive Support Emergency (ARISE) Project, financial accessibility was addressed through a two-pronged approach aimed at enhancing the resilience and sustainability of the agricultural sector amidst significant challenges, including conflict and natural or man-made disasters. Firstly, affordable credit was made available to farms, facilitating capital investment and operational continuity. This component targeted the broader agricultural ecosystem, ensuring entities of varying sizes could access the financial resources necessary for recovery and future growth. Secondly, the project instituted a grant system specifically tailored for small farms, recognizing the disproportionate impact of crises on smaller scale operators and the vital role these entities play in local food security and rural economies. Both methods were instrumented through the Business Development Fund and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, ensuring tailored, effective deployment of resources. This dual approach not only aimed at immediate recovery needs but also at fostering a more resilient agricultural infrastructure capable of withstanding future crises, thereby contributing to the broader objective of maintaining inclusive agricultural production.","Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, Business Development Fund",Europe and Central Asia,Ukraine,"[""'Environmental and Social Commitment Plan': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099101323081517746/pdf/P1807320b55dce08094c805edd1c25d291.pdf'"", ""'Project Appraisal Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099101923095537231/pdf/BOSIB0ba93e6360030a1f50cd2b8325e6e5.pdf'"", ""'Loan Agreement': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099110823104018617/pdf/P180732029a3570450a99a0bd5c5b50c75e.pdf'"", ""'Disbursement Letter': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099012224102528602/pdf/P1807321506d0708c1bfaa1a4e9704ee164.pdf'"", ""'Grant or Trust Fund Agreement': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099110823104512771/pdf/P18073205291e4085082aa0f5beef254bd0.pdf'"", ""'Minutes': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099111423164011650/pdf/BOSIB086de382c0e608db20aeb697ce1ee6.pdf'"", ""'Letter': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099121923092528294/pdf/P1807320a5970509a0b66a0d45aa616f92a.pdf'""]","['Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities']","['2023', '2024', '2025']","['Sergiy Zorya', 'Johanna Jaeger']"

P174137,Habitat Management and Restoration,Philippine Fisheries and Coastal Resiliency Project,"This use case example explores the execution of Marine Habitat Management and Restoration Plans (MHMRPs) within designated coastal zones. In the context of comprehensive Coastal Resource Management (CRM) efforts, the project paid special attention to the establishment of community-led management regimes for littoral and near-shore habitats. These regimes invited community participation in return for instituting sustainable management systems, complemented by initiatives such as beach clean-up, mangrove and coral reef rehabilitation, and restocking efforts. This method not only aimed at preserving critical habitats but also at empowering local communities through capacity building, technical assistance, and the implementation of sustainable management practices, thus fostering both ecological conservation and community resilience.",Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources,East Asia and Pacific,Philippines,"[""'Project Information Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099255012152126357/pdf/Project0Inform0y0Project000P174137.pdf'"", ""'Project Appraisal Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099051023165037940/pdf/BOSIB028a0c8a70c908b570ed2aadfbedc8.pdf'"", ""'Loan Agreement': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099062623084510710/pdf/P1741370f2c52a0f50bcf005515319fc9d8.pdf'"", ""'Disbursement Letter': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099062623084538915/pdf/P17413703c55f207f0870c084c050449b44.pdf'"", ""'Minutes': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099072623174017163/pdf/BOSIB0823d6e47052093e2091467ae9d647.pdf'"", ""'Implementation Status and Results Report': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099090323235023192/pdf/P174137007a70103f087ab0eb5b4f991567.pdf'"", ""'Environmental and Social Commitment Plan': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099111023165039342/pdf/P1741370cab8b80eb0b3770b291f0a4ad9a.pdf'"", ""'Procurement Plan': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099010624223528274/pdf/P174137112608c0f8190d81c96156b75c2b.pdf'""]","['Public Administration - Agriculture, Fishing & Forestry', 'Fisheries']","['2023', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029']","['Jingjie Chu', 'Milen F.
