The project built upon activities from the parent initiative by disseminating market information and investing in market infrastructure. An innovative strategy was to extend the projectâ€™s reach beyond the originally targeted value chains (poultry, rice, and soybeans) to include vegetables, cowpeas, and roots and tubers, which are crucial for local nutrition and livelihoods. The activities aimed to facilitate trade across key corridors and consolidate the food reserve system. This involved scaling up support for the dissemination of market information to help farmers access local, regional, and international markets, and establishing productive alliances between producers and aggregators for better commercialization of agricultural products. Additionally, the project aimed to enhance storage infrastructure and adopt post-harvest processing technologies through matching grants. The focus on promoting standards for quality and packaging aimed to meet market demands, benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), women and youth-led producer groups, and cooperatives within the targeted value chains.  \\n**Type:** use case  \\n**Project:** Additional Financing to West Africa Food Systems Resilience Program, Phase 1  \\n**Implementer:** Ministry of Agriculture - Niger, Ministry of Agriculture, Hydro-Agricultural Developments and Mechanization - Burkina Faso, Ministry of Rural Development - Mali, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development - Togo  \\n**Region:** Western and Central Africa  \\n**Country:** Western and Central Africa  \\n**Document(s):**  \\n - [Environmental and Social Review Summary] (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099071723120011453/pdf/P18113901889070520a3150583a67023157.pdf)  \\n - [Project Information Document](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099071123185032795/pdf/P1811390d3d36e0508ba40ba61471fc83a.pdf)  \\n - [Environmental and Social Commitment Plan](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099071723115524734/pdf/P18113908c7c400208c8a0667074738849.pdf)  \\n**Subtopic(s):** Agricultural markets, commercialization and agri-business, Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities, Crops, Livestock, Public Administration - Agriculture, Fishing & Forestry  \\n**Year(s):** 2023  \\n**Contact(s):** Katie Kennedy Freeman, Erick Herman Abiassi  \\n**Project ID:** P181139  \\n  \\nWould you like use to analyze any of the linked files or search for something else?\"\n",
