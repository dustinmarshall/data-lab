P154784,Enhancing Agro-weather & Advisory Services,Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project,"In response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture, the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project adeptly employed a methodology that significantly enhanced agro-weather, market, climate, and advisory services. Central to this approach was the installation of 154 Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs), including varied types such as Synoptic, Agro-meteorological, and Hydro-meteorological Stations. These AWSs provided critical data, enabling the formulation of informed agro-weather advisories for farmers. The project's integration with the Kenya Agricultural Market Information System (KAMIS) facilitated the provision of market information, making data accessible to farmers not only in Kenya but in 70 other countries globally. The establishment of a Big Data platform and a High Performing Computing System at KALRO transformed data processing capabilities, allowing for the generation of integrated advisories that reached a farmer database of 5 million individuals. Furthermore, support towards the expansion of crop insurance coverage for 39 counties, benefiting 1.2 million farmers, demonstrated a robust risk management strategy. This methodology illustrates a holistic approach to mitigating climate change impacts through technological integration and data-driven advisory services.",The National  Treasury,Eastern and Southern Africa,Republic of Kenya,"{'Procurement Plan': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099112923004032288/pdf/P1547840c630f70e80a1110a78da17ec133.pdf', 'Auditing Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099020124083016280/pdf/P15478410e64b409e1a4701e7acce9a1b02.pdf', 'Project Paper': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099122123044032863/pdf/P1547841090d7e05a18a92186ab6d0b9d47.pdf'}","Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry",2017,000515800$James Muli Musinga$jmusinga@worldbank.org
P164967,Seed Certification and Distribution,AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAM FOR RESULTS,"This agricultural project employed a comprehensive strategy for enhancing groundnut productivity in the Extended Groundnut Basin. A core component of this strategy was the certification and annual acquisition of groundnut seeds by local producers. Starting from a baseline of 40 metric tons, the project aimed to achieve an acquisition of 120,000 metric tons of certified groundnut seeds. To incentivize this ambitious goal, a financial formula was established, offering up to EUR 31,960,000 for incremental achievements above the baseline. For the initial target beyond the baseline, a significant fund was allocated, which progressively scaled up to the maximum predetermined budget, ensuring a structured and scalable financial support system. This approach not only motivated the local farmers to participate in the program but also facilitated the transition to increased use of certified seeds, directly contributing to the overarching goal of improving agricultural productivity and sustainability in the region. The structured financial incentives were pivotal in bridging the gap between traditional farming practices and modern, yield-enhancing agricultural technologies.",Ministry of Finance and Budget,Western and Central Africa,Republic of Senegal,"{'Implementation Status and Results Report': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099022324114542823/pdf/P16496712341050e61a2511b6841c53c29d.pdf', 'Project Paper': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099081523133013034/pdf/P1649671711b25bb11f3014de31b312101344dd35b6b.pdf', 'Disbursement Letter': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099400011092240355/pdf/P16496703f6f6401f096ee0b0e04dfc5081.pdf', 'Agreement': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099350111092238906/pdf/P1649670b9466d0e1089f800364a565f49b.pdf', 'Auditing Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099112923160031060/pdf/P1649670a5f9950410a2b10274e69481502.pdf'}","Public Administration - Agriculture, Fishing & Forestry",2020,000264447$Mazen Bouri$mbouri@worldbank.org
P164967,Empowerment Through Subsidization,AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAM FOR RESULTS,"In an effort to reinvigorate the agricultural sector within the Extended Groundnut Basin, the project implemented a precise strategy focused on subsidizing small-scale producers for the adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies. Starting from a modest baseline where only 40% of paid subsidies were targeted at producers with farmlands less than five hectares, the project envisioned a leap to 90% inclusivity. The mechanics of the subsidy involved a tiered financial engagement, with a budget earmarked at EUR 18,260,000 for this purpose alone. For every 10-percentage point increment in reaching the target population (small producers), an equitable portion of the fund was released, pacing evenly up to the fifth increment. This financial motivation catalyzed an enhanced engagement of small-scale farmers in sustainable practices, significantly impacting the program's goals by leveraging climate-smart technology for increased productivity and environmental sustainability. Through this approach, the project facilitated a seamless transition towards innovative practices among small-scale farmers, fostering resilience and sustainable development in the agricultural domain.",Ministry of Finance and Budget,Western and Central Africa,Republic of Senegal,"{'Implementation Status and Results Report': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099022324114542823/pdf/P16496712341050e61a2511b6841c53c29d.pdf', 'Project Paper': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099081523133013034/pdf/P1649671711b25bb11f3014de31b312101344dd35b6b.pdf', 'Disbursement Letter': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099400011092240355/pdf/P16496703f6f6401f096ee0b0e04dfc5081.pdf', 'Agreement': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099350111092238906/pdf/P1649670b9466d0e1089f800364a565f49b.pdf', 'Auditing Document': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099112923160031060/pdf/P1649670a5f9950410a2b10274e69481502.pdf'}","Public Administration - Agriculture, Fishing & Forestry",2020,000264447$Mazen Bouri$mbouri@worldbank.org
