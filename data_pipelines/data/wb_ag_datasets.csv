World - World Food Security Outlook,"Key components of the WFSO database cover severe food insecurity prevalence, estimates for countries lacking official data, population sizes of the severely food insecure, and required safety net financing. Data is presented in a user-friendly format.<br><br>WFSO data primarily relies on hunger and malnutrition data from the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report, led by the Food and agriculture Organization (FAO) in collaboration with multiple UN agencies. WFSO complements SOFI data by providing estimates for unreported countries. Historical estimates are produced with a World Bank machine learning model leveraging World Development Indicators (WDI) for global coverage. <br><br>Financing needs for safety nets are calculated similarly to past approaches by the International Development Association (IDA) to assess food insecurity response needs. Preliminary estimates and projections rely on the same model and incorporate IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) growth and inflation forecasts. WEO data reflects the IMF's expert analysis from various sources, including government agencies, central banks, and international organizations. <br><br>Minor gaps in WDI data inflation data are replaced with unofficial WEO estimates. Minor inflation data gaps not covered by both, are replaced with unofficial inflation estimates from the World Bank's Real-Time Food Prices (RTFP) data.<br><br>The WFSO is updated three times a year, coinciding with IMF's WEO and SOFI releases. It provides food security projections that align with economic forecasts, aiding policymakers in integrating food security into economic planning.<br><br>The WFSO database serves various purposes, aiding World Bank economists and researchers in economic analysis, policy recommendations, and the assessment of global financing needs to address food insecurity.<br><br>Additionally, the WFSO enhances transparency in global food security data by tracking regional and global figures and breaking them down by individual countries. Historical estimates support research and long-term trend assessments, especially in the context of relating outlooks to past food security crises.",0065233,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Tanzania - Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey 2022,"The primary objective of the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (2022 TDHSMIS) is to provide current and reliable information on population and health issues. Specifically, the 2022 TDHS-MIS collected information on marriage and sexual activity, fertility and fertility preferences, family planning, infant and child mortality, maternal health care, disability among the household population, child health, nutrition of children and women, malaria prevalence, knowledge, and communication, women’s empowerment, women’s experience of domestic violence, adult maternal mortality via sisterhood method, awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), female genital cutting, and early childhood development. Other information collected on health-related issues included smoking, blood pressure, anaemia, malaria, and iodine testing, height and weight, and micronutrients.<br><br>The information collected through the 2022 TDHS-MIS is intended to assist policymakers and programme managers in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving the health of Tanzania’s population. The 2022 TDHS-MIS also provides indicators to monitor and evaluate international, regional, and national programmes, such as the Global Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development Goals (2030 SDGs), Tanzania Development Vision 2025, the Third National Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP III 2021/22–2025/26), East Africa Community Vision 2050 (EAC 2050), and Africa Development Agenda 2063 (ADA 2063).",0065150,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Mozambique - Impact Evaluation of the Sustainable Land and Water Resource Management Project 2016-2019,"The main objective of this activity is to shed light on the transformative potential of smallholder irrigation in Mozambique. Irrigation is critical in ensuring sustainable livelihoods for farmers in the face of increasing climate uncertainty. Irrigation access allows farmers to cultivate crops outside of the main rainy season, potentially doubling farm incomes by allowing for the cultivation of two crop cycles instead of one. However, it is grossly underutilized in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Mozambique where only 8 percent of all farmers have access to irrigation. Despite the transformative potential of irrigation, there are gaps in our understanding of how-to best plan and manage irrigation infrastructure programs. First, because irrigation infrastructure is never placed at random, the true impact of these investments on farmers’ welfare is not well known. Second, irrigation equipment is often not well managed and degrades easily over time from lack of maintenance. This impact evaluation proposes a novel strategy for simultaneously measuring a rigorous estimate of the returns to irrigation investments, as well as providing insight on how to choose participants of an irrigation infrastructure program such that the impact and sustainability of the irrigation infrastructure is maximized.",0065012,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Jamaica - The Gains at Age 30 Years From the Supplementation and Stimulation Study 2017-2018,"This study reports the labor market effects of the Jamaica Early Childhood Stimulation intervention at age 31. The study is a small-sample randomized early childhood education stimulation intervention targeting stunted children living in the poor neighborhoods of Kingston, Jamaica. Implemented in 1987–89, treatment consisted of a two-year, home-based intervention designed to improve nutrition and the quality of mother-child interactions to foster cognitive, language, and psycho-social skills. The original sample was 127 stunted children between ages 9 and 24 months. The 2017-2018 study was able to track and interview 75 percent of the original sample 30 years after the intervention, both still living in Jamaica and migrated abroad. The findings reveal large and statistically significant effects on income and schooling; the treatment group had 43 percent higher hourly wages and 37 percent higher earnings than the control group. This is a substantial increase over the treatment effect estimated for age 22, when a 25 percent increase in earnings was observed.",0064785,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Tajikistan - Post-Distribution Monitoring of Cash-Based Intervention 2023,"THE CBI PDM Household Survey was conducted in Tajikistan in January 2023. Tajikistan hosts the largest number of refugees in Central Asia, predominantly from neighbouring Afghanistan. While some progress has been achieved in areas such as access to health and education for refugees, livelihoods and self-reliance, though, continue to pose a challenge. As the result of Covid-19, refugees faced a myriad of challenges, including the loss of daily incomes and livelihoods to cover basic needs such as rent, food and health care. For refugees in Tajikistan, who largely rely on daily work, the impact of Covid 19 has been devastating as it has led to widespread unemployment. As a response measure, UNHCR jointly with its NGO partner provided Covid-19 cash assistance to 183 refugee households over the course of six months. The results from this survey suggest that cash assistance provided as an immediate measure to support vulnerable refugee households has had a positive impact on the lives of the respondents. Cash assistance predominantly has been spent to cover food, medicines and rent costs.<br><br>UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive.

"India - Jeevika Livelihoods Project, Phase 1 - One Round ""Retrospective"" Evaluation.  Household Survey Data 2011","Poverty reduction via formation of community based organizations is a popular approach in regions of high socio-economic marginalization, especially in South Asia. The shortage of evidence on the impacts of such an approach is an outcome of the complexity of these projects, which almost always have a multi-sectoral design to achieve a comprehensive basket of aims. In the current research, we consider results from a rural livelihoods program in Bihar, one of India’s poorest states. Adopting a model prevalent in several Indian states, the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project, known locally as JEEViKA, relies on mobilizing women from impoverished, socially marginalized households into Self Help Groups. Simultaneously, activities such as micro-finance and technical assistance for agricultural livelihoods are taken up by the project and routed to the beneficiaries via these institutions; these institutions also serve as a platform for women to come together and discuss a multitude of the socio-economic problems that they face. We use a retrospective survey instrument, coupled with PSM techniques to find that JEEViKA, has engendered some significant results in restructuring the debt portfolio of these households; additionally, JEEViKA has been instrumental in providing women with higher levels of empowerment, as measured by various dimensions.<br><br>In the current research, we consider a multi-sectoral approach which closely resembles the APDPIP design. We take a close look at the impacts of a rural poverty reduction program in Bihar, one of India’s poorest states. This program JEEViKA, focusses on building Self Help Groups (SHGs) of marginalized women; these groups are then federated into higher order institutions of such women at the village and local level. Cheap credit for a variety of purposes, technical assistance for various livelihood activities and encouraging awareness about various public services are the key agendas of this program. However, due to the very nature of JEEViKA’s target population, and given Bihar’s vicious income and gender inequality, the potential for impacts on women’s empowerment exists. A retrospective survey instrument, coupled with ‘Propensity Score Matching’ methods are used to estimate the impacts. <br><br>The results from the survey point out that JEEViKA has played an instrumental role in restructuring the debt portfolio of beneficiary households; households that have SHG members have a significantly lower high cost debt burden, are able to access smaller loans repeatedly and borrow more often for productive purposes, when compared to households without SHG members. Since JEEViKA works by mobilizing marginalized women into institutional platforms, such women demonstrate higher levels of empowerment, when empowerment is measured by mobility, decision making and collective action. Finally, we see some effects on the asset positions, food security and sanitation preferences of beneficiary households. It is worth pointing out here that the extent and significance of the results on debt portfolio and empowerment are robust to various matching modules and various specifications of the matched sample. The results on the other dimensions are subject to specifications or matching modules.<br><br>This brings out to the point about the timeline of these interventions and the materialization of impacts. In the context of such iterative, multi-sectoral poverty reduction approach, a well_x0002_designed research question must be able to identify the goals that a project should have achieved, given the time-line of that evaluation; the extent of such achievements are only a part of the evaluation agenda. The short review provided above provides some clues that a regular evaluation horizon of 2/3 years may be insufficient time to observe higher order effects, especially since actual benefits happen only after poor are mobilized into institutions and institutions are federated into higher-order institutions; indeed, the village-level institution, the Village Organization, which is made of 15 SHGs on an average, becomes functional 8-10 months after JEEViKA enters a village for the first time. The retrospective nature of the survey instrument also rules out any meaningful comparison of consumption or income levels between treatment and control areas.",0064626,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Ethiopia - Impact Evaluation of the Food Security Project for Poorer Rural Households in Ethiopia 2010,"At the time of Appraisal of the Food Security Project, Ethiopia was a post-conflict state having just emerged from a two-year long armed conflict with Eritrea. Though the conflict resulted in a suspension of development assistance, an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was put in place in November 2000 to guide the World Bank’s post-conflict recovery program. This ISN guided much of the strategy for the Food Security Project’s design. District governments, or woredas, were largely responsible for delivering services. Though the agricultural sector remained underemployed, it was still the largest sector of the economy, meaning there was little opportunity outside rural areas for non-farming activities. Poor rural households also lacked sufficient access to the microfinance sector. Droughts and food price escalation caused massive food insecurity for around 7-13 million people. The Food Security Project (FSP) wanted to shift assistance focus away from short term temporary fixes toward addressing long-term problems of food insecurity. The FSP was designed to comprise 5 components: (i) grants to communities and kebeles, including community-level assets building, household asset building and income generating activities, and child growth promotion; (ii) capacity building for woredas, regions, and federal ministries; (iii) food marketing initiatives, including improved management of food aid, establishment of a food market information system, development of a warehouse receipt and inventory credit system for traders, and development of a competitive and efficient market in warehousing services; (iv) communications and public education; and (v) project administration and impact evaluation. While these components were edited before the culmination of the project, they generally remained. The project development objective was to build the resource base of poorer rural households, increase their employment and incomes, and improve their nutrition levels, especially for children under five years of age, pregnant and lactating women. A major benefit of FSP participation is access to credit. Documented outcomes included: (i) small increase in the number of months FSP households were food secure and a small decrease in number of months of food consumption covered by own resources; (ii) positive effect on caregivers’ knowledge of and behavior regarding child nutrition; (iii) FSP households slightly less likely to have had at least one shock in the last five years and less likely to have used savings or a loan to buy food; and (iv) FSP households reported an increase of off-farm work.",0064615,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"India - Impact Evaluation Survey of JEEViKA Multisectoral Convergence Initiative in Bihar, 2018","This Impact Evaluation (IE), a randomized controlled trial, tested the effectiveness of using the women’s self-help group platform of Bihar’s JEEViKA program to address the immediate and underlying determinants of undernutrition among women and children andimprove nutrition outcomes. JEEViKA is a rural livelihoods project, supported by the World Bank in Bihar that supports self-helpgroups (SHGs) – savings and credit-based groups of about 15-20 women, mostly targeted towards those from poor households –with the aim of improving their livelihoods and enhancing household incomes. The JEEViKA Multisectoral Convergence (JEEViKA-MC)pilot, developed by the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society with technical support from the World Bank, was designed to leverage these SHGs to provide two complementary sets of interventions—health and nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) to improve women’s knowledge and household practices, and efforts to improve service access through convergence —alongside the existing core package of JEEViKA. The core JEEViKA interventions include: the organization of rural women into SHGs,training and strengthening the SHGs, federation of the SHGs into Village Organizations (VOs) and Cluster-Level Federations (CLFs),bank linkages for the SHGs and their federations, and improvement of livelihoods and women’s empowerment through extensionservices and related interventions.

"Burkina Faso - The Effects of Childcare on Women and Children: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation, 2019","The government of Burkina Faso through its Youth Employment and Skills Project (PEJDC) recruited 10,255 young women (85%) and men (15%) in 49 communes to implement labor-intensive public works (“PTR-HIMO”, in French) in all regions of the country from mid-July 2019. <br><br>The eligibility conditions were: <br>i) being a Burkina Faso citizen;<br>ii) out of school or never enrolled in school;<br>iii) not a former beneficiary of the project; and <br>iv) aged 16 to 35. <br><br>PTR-HIMO participants were selected through a call for applications for the public work scheme in each commune by the government. The childcare intervention was designed to address the constraint that childcare responsibilities impose on women’s time. Prior to the intervention, female public works participants typically organized themselves by identifying some among them to look after their children while the others were conducting the public works. The PEJDC project team developed the “mobile creches” as an innovative childcare intervention to formalize childcare responsibilities by establishing a quality source of childcare that would allow women to focus on productive activities. This development process involved close collaboration with the Ministry of National Education and the Ministry of Women. The intervention was introduced as a pilot in Manga, one of the communes of a preceding World Bank-financed public works project. The mobile creches childcare intervention was integrated in the public works component of the PEJDC to follow participants as they move from work site to work site. <br><br>The intervention includes:<br>i) availability during PTR-HIMO working hours of full coverage tents or existing safe spaces that offer an environment designed specifically for children aged 0 to 6 years, with added protection from the sun, dust, inclement weather, and potential accidents; <br>ii) two nutritious meals per day <br>iii) low-cost toys and learning materials; and <br>iv) information for parents on childcare and nutrition based on contents from Burkina’s national program of parental education. <br><br>The maximum capacity for each childcare center was 50 children. Satellite creches were also introduced close to the public works site to allow breastfeeding infants to remain close to their mothers. Each childcare center was operated by 7 to 10 public works participants who received a 3-day training to become “brigadieres assistantes maternelles” (BAMs) and would then attend to children in the centers. Interested participants at each public works site were asked to volunteer. Volunteers were screened based on a set of selection criteria, after which 10 volunteers from each site were selected to receive a 3-day training before starting to operate the childcare centers. BAMs received the same compensation as other brigadiers and worked the same schedule of hours but at the childcare centers instead of working in the labor-intensive public works assigned to their peers.<br><br>BAMs continued to receive the same 37,000 FCFA monthly wage for each month they worked at the childcare centers after the public works ended. Centers were supported by supervision visits from government education and social workers. Parents were asked to provide a nominal contribution of approximately USD 6 per month for snacks, although this was on a voluntary basis and payment was not enforced. During the public works, the childcare centers officially operated during the same hours as the public works, i.e., 8 am to 2 pm. In practice, the centers were open as early as 6 am to welcome the children.",0064597,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Liberia - Global Agriculture and Food Security Project Impact Evaluation 2017,"The continued development of Liberia’s agricultural sector is crucial to Liberia’s economic growth and food security. A focus on smallholder farmers helps to ensure pro-poor growth; over 70% of Liberia’s population is involved in farming and the vast majority of this population practice cultivation at the subsistence level, utilizing traditional techniques. The Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Enhancement and Commercialization project (SAPEC) aims to improve the productivity, income and nutritional outcomes of beneficiary farmers in 12 of Liberia’s 15 counties. SAPEC provides farmers with agricultural technologies, constructs and rehabilitates infrastructure to support value-chains and market linkages, as well is working to improve the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and associated research institutions. The impact evaluation focuses most directly through the most rigorous methods on the input delivery component. SAPEC’s design incorporates a focus on women, youth and the disabled to better integrate these groups into the agricultural sector and improve their capacity. Given Liberia’s relatively low life expectancy and high youth population (42% below age 15; LISGIS 2011), it is particularly important to encourage youth participation in agriculture. Declining youth participation in the agriculture sector across Africa prompts concerns that if youth are the most open to new technologies, programs promoting new agricultural methods and varieties may struggle to convince farmers to try these new methods unless they can recruit young farmers.<br><br>We propose to study the impact of seed and tool distribution on the take-up of modern farming inputs and the use of productivity enhancing tools, thereby resulting in higher agricultural yields and improved nutritional outcomes, as measured by dietary diversity scores.

Nigeria - General Household Survey 2010-2019,"Panel data possess several advantages over conventional cross-sectional and time-series data, including their power to isolate the effects of specific actions, treatments, and general policies often at the core of large-scale econometric development studies. While the concept of panel data alone provides the capacity for modeling the complexities of human behavior, the notion of universal panel data – in which time- and situation-driven variances leading to variations in tools, and thus results, are mitigated – can further enhance exploitation of the richness of panel information.<br><br>The Basic Information Document (BID) provides a brief overview of the Nigerian General Household Survey (GHS) but focuses primarily on the theoretical development and application of panel data, as well as key elements of the universal panel survey instrument and datasets generated by the four rounds of the GHS. As the BID does not describe in detail the background, development, or use of the GHS itself, the wave-specific GHS BIDs should supplement the information provided here.<br><br>The Nigeria Universal Panel Data (NUPD) consists of both survey instruments and datasets from the two survey visits of the GHS - Post-Planting (PP) and Post-Harvest (PH) - meticulously aligned and engineered with the aim of facilitating the use of and improving access to the wealth of panel data offered by the GHS. The NUPD provides a consistent and straightforward means of conducting user-driven analyses using convenient, standardized tools.<br><br>The design of the NUPD combines the four completed Waves of the GHS Household Post-Planting and Post-Harvest Surveys – Wave 1 (2010/11), Wave 2 (2012/13), Wave 3 (2015/16), and Wave 4 (2018/19) – into pooled, module-specific survey instruments and datasets. The panel survey instruments offer the ease of comparability over time, with modifications and variances easily identifiable as well as those aspects of the questionnaire which have remained identical and offer consistent information. By providing all module-specific data over time within compact, pooled datasets, panel datasets eliminate the need for user-generated merges between rounds and present data in a clear, logical format, increasing both the usability and comprehension of complex data.",0064517,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Uganda - Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis 2019, ACREI","In order to make the progressive Uganda refugees policy successful in the medium- and long-term, the refugees’ response needs to facilitate their inclusion in the country’s development agenda. No longer focusing exclusively on short-term, life-saving interventions, the response should act as a vector for refugees’ integration in the economy; improving the management of land, water, and natural resources; exploiting the socio-economic opportunities associated with the refugees’ presence, skills, and development; and strengthening the hosting districts’ capacity to absorb and manage these resources. The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities, and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance. The Uganda 2019 acrei Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) measures the food security and resilience of refugees and host communities in Northern Uganda.

Mongolia - Pastoralists-driven Data Management System 2018-2019,"Basic information is lacking about many pastoralist areas in the world. As a result, many services, programmes and policies do not effectively address the needs of pastoralist communities. The Government Cooperative Programme (GCP) project GCP/GLO/779/IF “Pastoralists-driven Data Management System”, was based on the idea that pastoralist associations could themselves collect, manage and share data from among their communities. This information could then be used to advocate for better targeted and pastoralist-friendly policies at local, national and international level. The project aimed at strengthening the capacities of pastoral organizations in data collection, analysis and information management, in order to facilitate evidence-based policy decision-making. It was implemented in Argentina, Chad and Mongolia, managed by the Pastoralist Knowledge Hub (PKH), and supported by the Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement (Agricultural Research Centre for International Development [CIRAD]).<br><br>In Mongolia, the project was implemented by the National Federation of Pastoralist User Groups. An innovative approach for collecting data was developed through close partnership among the stakeholders involved, and was adopted during two successive surveys. The two questionnaires for collecting data on pastoralism were discussed and adapted to the national context, through the contribution of the participants and their deep knowledge of the field. This was one of the most innovative and successful aspects of the project, i.e. the pertinence of the method, as a result of the proactive involvement of the beneficiaries. The first survey, which aimed to identify and describe the pastoralist population, gathered information on 112,957 households. The second survey, which was more in-depth and aimed to assess the pastoralist economy and its contribution to the national economies, was conducted on a sample (based on the results of the first survey) of 1,938 households. As well as demonstrating that pastoralist organizations had the potential to successfully manage data, the surveys revealed the actual contribution of pastoralism to the economy of the country. In particular, they showed that pastoralism contributed to the national economy more than studies usually indicated, as, owing to specific characteristics, such as high levels of self-consumption, pastoralists' contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was often underestimated .

Chad - Pastoralists-driven Data Management System 2018-2019,"Basic information is lacking about many pastoralist areas in the world. As a result, many services, programmes and policies do not effectively address the needs of pastoralist communities. The Government Cooperative Programme (GCP) project GCP/GLO/779/IF “Pastoralists-driven Data Management System”, was based on the idea that pastoralist associations could themselves collect, manage and share data from among their communities. This information could then be used to advocate for better targeted and pastoralist-friendly policies at local, national and international level. The project aimed at strengthening the capacities of pastoral organizations in data collection, analysis and information management, in order to facilitate evidence-based policy decision-making. It was implemented in Argentina, Chad and Mongolia, managed by the Pastoralist Knowledge Hub (PKH), and supported by the Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement - CIRAD). <br><br>In Chad, the project was implemented by the Billital Maroobe Network (Réseau Billital Maroobé - RBM). An innovative approach for collecting data was developed through close partnership among the stakeholders involved, and was adopted during two successive surveys. The two questionnaires for collecting data on pastoralism were discussed and adapted to the national context, through the contribution of the participants and their deep knowledge of the field. This was one of the most innovative and successful aspects of the project, i.e. the pertinence of the method, as a result of the proactive involvement of the beneficiaries. The first survey, which aimed to identify and describe the pastoralist population, gathered information on 8,938 households. The second survey, which was more in-depth and aimed to assess the pastoralist economy and its contribution to the national economies, was conducted on a sample (based on the results of the first survey) of 1,010 households. As well as demonstrating that pastoralist organizations had the potential to successfully manage data, the surveys revealed the actual contribution of pastoralism to the economy of the country. In particular, they showed that pastoralism contributed to the national economy more than studies usually indicated, as, owing to specific characteristics, such as high levels of self-consumption, pastoralists' contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was often underestimated . During the project, it emerged that pastoralism could contribute up to 27 percent to the GDP of Chad.",0064209,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Chad - Support Program for Rural Development in the Guéra, IFAD Impact Assessment Surveys 2017","Smallholder farmers in developing countries often lack appropriate cereal storage facilities which can contribute to food insecurity and low cereal commercialization, particularly when they can only rely on one cropping season with no irrigation. Lack of quality storage can lead to post-harvest losses (Abass et al, 2014; Sheahan and Barrett, 2017) and often compels smallholder farmers to sell their crops soon after harvest, when crop prices are at their seasonal lowest, only for them to buy grain for consumption during the lean season, when prices are high (Kadjo et al, 2018; Aggarwal et al, 2018; Stephens and Barrett, 2011). In many instances, such farmers need food assistance to survive the lean season and in other cases, they may have to borrow money at usurious rates in order to purchase food. This was the case in Guéra Region of Chad, a semi-arid area that frequently experiences droughts and dry spells in ways that severely reduce crop production and rural households’ food security. <br><br>To address these issues, the IFAD-funded Programme d'Appui au Développement Rural dans le Guéra (PADER-G) project was implemented with the main objective of supporting poor rural households and smallholder farmers in Guéra, Chad to improve their food security and livelihoods. One specific aim of PADER-G, designed to manage risks of food shortage, was to improve cereal storage among smallholder farmers through the construction of community cereal banks (banque de céréales). This main element of the project was complemented with the establishment of community committees (Comité de gestion des banques de soudure – COGES) which were trained on effective management of the cereal banks.<br><br>This data refer to the ex-post impact assessment of the PADER-G community cereal banks intervention. The impact assessment employed various methods, which proved robust across a number of estimated impacts. The inverse-probability-weighted matching techniques on household data collected from villages that benefited from the community cereal banks (the treatment) and villages that did not benefit from the PADER-G cereal banks (the control) were used for the main report, however additional results are available in the appendix. The inverse-probability-weighted regression-adjustment (IPWRA) and other variants of matching techniques were used to assess the impact of PADER-G cereal bank interventions on several outcome and impact indicators, including household income, assets, food security, dietary diversity and resilience indicators.

"Brazil - Rural Community Development Project - Gente de Valor, IFAD Impact Assessment Surveys 2019","As part of its greater portfolio in Northeast Brazil, IFAD supported the Brazilian government and State of Bahia to implement the Rural Communities Development Project in the Poorest Areas of the State of Bahia (PRODECAR), popularly referred to as Gente de Valor (GDV), between 2007 and 2013 .The purpose of GDV was to address the multitude of basic service gaps, empowerment deficit, and productive capacity needs experienced by residents of Brazil's Northeast region. Beneficiaries were drawn from the local population of sertanejos; a regional population named in reference to the dryland, sertão agro-climatic zone and among the poorest people in Brazil. As a CDD-style project, GDV's objective was to address their needs through a participatory process that would provide access to water-harvesting cisterns (primarily for household consumption), training on ecologically appropriate agricultural practices, technical assistance and technical inputs, as well as community capacitation to identify and address future development needs. <br><br>GDV was selected to be part of the IFAD10 Impact Assessment Agenda that consists of a broader set of impact assessments across the world. The aim is to generate evidence and provide lessons for better rural poverty reduction programs and to measure the impact of IFAD-supported programmes on enhancing rural people's economic mobility, increased agricultural productive capacity, improved market participation and increased resilience. <br><br>As almost six years having passed since the project closed, the analysis evaluates the sustainable impacts of GDV under the realm of access to infrastructure, agricultural productivity, poverty impacts, and empowerment of both women, youth and the community at large. Given the role that drought plays in affecting the economic opportunities of sertanejos, it is also relevant that this project evaluates outcomes following the recent multi-year drought. From the years 2010 to 2016, Bahia experienced a drought characterized as one of the worst of the century; affecting 33.4 million people and resulting in an estimated damage of approximately 30 billion USD (Marengo et al., 2017). <br><br>For more information, please, click on the following link <https://www.ifad.org/en/web/knowledge/-/publication/impact-assessment-gente-de-valor-rural-communities-development-project-in-the-poorest-areas-of-the-state-of-bahia>.",0064186,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
"Bolivia - Project Plan VIDA-PEEP, IFAD Impact Assessment Surveys 2017","In August 2011, implementation began on the project Plan VIDA-PEEP (PPV), an initiative financed jointly between IFAD and the Bolivian Government as part of the country's National Development Plan. It aimed to reduce extreme poverty in rural areas and improve the livelihoods of households residing in vulnerable municipalities in the departments of Potosi and Cochabamba through capacity building, financing of rural development projects, and by supporting citizenship and social inclusion. The project lasted five years in total and was completed in December, 2016. <br><br>The project was designed around two main components. The first component aimed at increasing means of production and at strengthening productive assets and management practices. This would be achieved through financial support to communities for the implementation of rural development projects and to municipalities for the realization of production infrastructure projects. The second component consisted of community training and capacity building focused on organizational and productive capacity. It included campaigns aimed at documenting unregistered people in targeted municipalities which would lead to increased social inclusion and access to basic and financial services. In Bolivia, such documentation has been shown to mitigate cases of political and social exclusion (Harbitz and Tamargo 2009).<br><br>This impact assessment looks at the effects of rural development projects funded by Plan VIDA on the livelihood of rural households residing in beneficiary communities (i.e., Component 1). In particular, the evaluation focuses on a specific category of projects - Community Based Productive Investments (Proyectos Inter Comunales - PICs) - which account for more than 90 per cent of total beneficiary households reached by Plan VIDA at completion and also constitute the vast majority of the recipients of capacity building activities (i.e., Component 2).<br><br>This impact assessment investigated whether the Plan VIDA project, with its unique mechanisms, contributed to well-being of beneficiaries, measured through key outcome indicators of economic mobility, resilience and nutrition to respond to IFAD's strategic objectives and goals and to Bolivia's National Development Plan.<br><br>To answer these questions, the ex-post evaluation applied a quasi-experimental design approach that combines statistical methods and qualitative analysis to identify a valid counterfactual. As sufficient data were not collected at baseline of the project, the research team relied on one round of data collected between August and September 2017 that is, about eight months after project completion. Data were collected from 2,751 household including beneficiaries of the project, indirect beneficiaries (those in the same community but not direct recipients of intervention), and households which serve as a control group.<br><br>For more information, please, click on the following link <https://www.ifad.org/en/web/knowledge/-/publication/impact-assessment-plan-vida-bolivia>.",0064185,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
"Bangladesh - Coastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project, IFAD Impact Assessment Surveys 2018","The Coastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project (CCRIP) is a rural road and market infrastructure project which was implemented in 12 districts of Bangladesh from 2013 to 2019. The project goal was to achieve improved livelihoods (higher income and food security) for poor households in the selected sub-districts (Upazilas) through enhancements in the rural infrastructure. The project aimed to improve the connectivity of farms and households in the face of climatic shocks, focusing on one of the most shock-prone areas in the world (the delta regions of Bangladesh). The main component of the project is the construction of improved markets and market connecting roads that are designed to remain useable during the monsoon season. This was expected to improve sales of on- farm produce, along with access to inputs as well as opportunities for off-farm income generation, leading to increased productivity and income. The project also aimed to improve women's empowerment by employing Labor Contracting Societies (LCS), consisting mainly of destitute women, to carry out some of the construction work.<br><br>In 2018, a collaborative data collection exercise was conducted by the project team and a team from the Research and Impact Assessment (RIA) Division of IFAD to be used for both the project's Mid-Term Report and an impact assessment study. The impact assessment focused on activities related to strengthening of markets and roads at the community levels. Data were collected from 3,000 treatment and control households using an in-depth quantitative household questionnaire. This enabled analysis of the project's impact on a range of impact indicators relating to income; crop, fish and livestock production and sales; assets, food security and education; financial inclusion; and women's empowerment.<br><br>For more information, please, click on the following link  <https://www.ifad.org/en/web/knowledge/-/publication/impact-assessment-coastal-climate-resilient-infrastructure-project-ccrip->.",0064184,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Uganda - Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis 2020,"In order to make the progressive Uganda refugees policy successful in the medium- and long-term, the refugees’ response needs to facilitate their inclusion in the country’s development agenda. No longer focusing exclusively on short-term, life-saving interventions, the response should act as a vector for refugees’ integration in the economy; improving the management of land, water, and natural resources; exploiting the socio-economic opportunities associated with the refugees’ presence, skills, and development; and strengthening the hosting districts’ capacity to absorb and manage these resources. The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities, and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance.

Senegal - Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis 2015,"Matam is one of the poorest regions of Senegal. Located in the northeast of the country, more than 45 percent of the population of Matam is under the poverty line (ANSD/SRSD, 2015). In this region, agriculture and pastoralism are the largest economic sectors, thus recent climatic changes strongly influence the number of malnourished people. Notwithstanding the numerous advances made in recent decades by the Government of Senegal in terms of increasing education rates and reinforcing numerous forms of infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals and schools, Matam still experiences infrastructure weakness and poor access to numerous basic services. Furthermore, Matam falls behind in a range of human development indicators in comparison to other Senegalese regions. Nevertheless, a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) resilience analysis based on the Enquête de Suivi de la Pauvreté au Sénégal I (ESPS I) found Matam to be one of the most resilient regions within Senegal. While this result may be in line with the typically high levels of adaptive, transformative and coping capacities of the poorest regions around the world, this result still warranted further investigation. Therefore, an ad hoc survey was carried out by FAO Resilience Analysis and Policies (RAP) team in Matam between December 2015 and January 2016, with the support of the Agence National de Statistique et de la Démographie (ANSD). The resilience survey was conducted within 410 households within the districts of Ranérou, Matam and Kanel in Matam Region.",0064065,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Drought, for example, is a common phenomenon in the south of Mauritania, which favors food insecurity and malnutrition, and significantly reduces household resilience while increasing their vulnerability to future shocks. Apart from the fact that only 0.5 percent of the land is suitable for agriculture, Mauritania consists of reliefs and very large, fragile agroecological complexes which are also faced with the effects of climate change.<br><br>In recent years, food crises and nutritional factors have been regularly observed due to structural causes which has poverty as its common denominator. These crises, as well as, climatic factors have a negative consequence on natural resources and reduce the resilience of livelihoods, thereby generating a loss in productivity and poor governance of natural resources. The concept of resilience generally defines the capacity of individuals, households, communities and countries to absorb shocks and adapt to a changing environment, while transforming the institutional environment in the long term. Thus, it is necessary to set up interventions that will have an impact on adaptability and risk management over time, in order to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households.<br><br>For more than 10 years, FAO has measured the household resilience index in different countries, using a tool developed for this purpose; Resilience Index Measure and Analysis (RIMA).

As an integrated survey covering a number of different socioeconomic factors, it compliments other more narrowly focused survey efforts, such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) on health, the Integrated Labour Force Survey (ILFS) on labour markets, the Household Budget Survey (HBS) on expenditure, and the National Sample Census of Agriculture (NSCA). Secondly, as a panel household survey in which the same households are revisited over time, the NPS allows for the study of poverty and welfare transitions and the determinants of living standard changes.",0064000,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Cameroon - Mayo-Tsanaga Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Profiling, July-September 2021","Violent extremism carried out by the Boko Haram group in Nigeria and government measures to contain it have led to intense population movement and human suffering in the Lake Chad basin. Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are particularly affected.

As of October 2021, the Far North region had 341,535 IDPs and 124,310 returnees (IOM DTM Round 22). In order to ensure the protection of IDPs in the three departments most affected in the Far North (Mayo-Sava, Mayo-Tsanaga et Logone-Et-Chari), a need was expressed by the different actors in the region and the authorities for credible detailed statistics on the IDP households and individuals that could be used for planning purposes. In this light, UNHCR supported the authorities in undertaking an IDP pilot profiling exercise between July and September 2021 in Mayo-Tsanaga.<br><br>The profiling collected data on a number of topics that could be used to assess the needs of the IDP population and identify solutions, namely living conditions, food security, essential items and legal protection.

More detailed background information is available at http://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/fies/en/ .<br><br>The FIES-based indicators are compiled using the FIES survey module, containing 8 questions. Two indicators can be computed:<br>1. The proportion of the population experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity (SDG indicator 2.1.2),<br>2. The proportion of the population experiencing severe food insecurity. <br><br>These data were collected by FAO through the Gallup World Poll. General information on the methodology can be found here: https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx. National institutions can also collect FIES data by including the FIES survey module in nationally representative surveys.<br><br>Microdata can be used to calculate the indicator 2.1.2 at national level. Instructions for computing this indicator are described in the methodological document available in the documentations tab. Disaggregating results at sub-national level is not encouraged because estimates will suffer from substantial sampling and measurement error.",0063498,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Uganda - Community Perception Survey - 2019,"This data includes responses to Ground Truth Solutions' perception survey conducted in October 2019 with 1511 refugees in Uganda. Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.<br><br>Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).<br><br>Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.<br><br>Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. <br><br>Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",0063495,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Afghanistan - Eastern Region: Post-Distribution Monitoring of Cash-Based Interventions 2020,"Cash-based Interventions (CBIs) are a dignified form of assistance, giving recipients the ability to immediately prioritise and address their needs for food, shelter/accommodation, and other necessities. CBIs also directly complement community protection measures and support the local economy and can contribute to peaceful coexistence within and across communities. UNHCR Afghanistan has used cash-based interventions for several years for a wide range of purposes, including voluntary repatriation, basic needs, community-based protection, and livelihoods among others. UNHCR seeks to improve cash programming by regularly and systematically collecting information through post-distribution monitoring (PDM) on several aspects related to UNHCR’s CBIs including efficiency of cash delivery, access to markets, use of cash, unmet needs and coping strategies. Findings are expected to help UNHCR to improve the way the CBIs are designed and delivered. <br><br>This PDM covers two CBI programmes delivered by UNHCR in in the Eastern Region of Afghanistan in 2020, cash for protection and cash for shelter. Cash for protection was designed to support households with specific protection profiles to cope with the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and avoid harmful coping strategies. Cash for shelter was designed to support vulnerable households with conditional cash grants to construct safe and dignified shelter. While the programmes were carried out countrywide, supporting 13,792 households with cash for protection and 506 with cash for shelter, the Eastern Region supported the largest number of CBI recipients. As such, this region was prioritized for the PDM data collection which took place in Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces.",0063457,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Brazil - COVID-19 High Frequency Phone Survey 2021,"The Brazil 2021 COVID-19 Phone Survey was conducted to provide information on how the pandemic had been affecting Brazilian households in 2021. It was inspired by the Latin America and Caribbean High Frequency Phone Surveys and collected information along multiple dimensions relevant to the welfare of the population (e.g. changes in employment and income, coping mechanisms, access to health and education services, gender inequalities, and food insecurity). A total of 2,166 phone interviews were conducted across all Brazilian states between July 26 and October 1, 2021. The survey followed a Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sampling methodology using a dual sampling frame of cellphone and landline numbers. The sampling frame was stratified by type of phone and state. Results are nationally representative for households with a landline or at least one cell phone and of individuals of ages 18 years and above who have an active cell phone number or a landline at home.",0063345,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Nepal - Baseline, Midline, Endline and Follow-up Surveys on Community Challenge Fund, 2013-2016","While substantial progress has been made in combating malnutrition at a global level, chronic maternal and child malnutrition remains a serious problem in many parts of the developing world. In this paper, using a randomized control trial design in Nepal, we evaluate a program that provided information on best practices regarding infant health and cash to families in extremely poor areas with pregnant mothers and/or children below the age of 2. We find significant and sizable impacts of the information plus cash intervention on maternal knowledge and behavior in the short run. We also find suggestive evidence of improvements in child development for the information plus cash intervention relative to groups that received information only. In a long-run 2 year follow up survey, we find that the information plus cash group retained significantly higher knowledge and implementation of best practices regarding early childhood health. However, there appear to be no sustained impacts on child development or anthropometrics in the follow up.",0063300,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

We expect the irrigation system improvements to differentially impact farmers living in different parts of the scheme with the primary difference being whether the farmer lives in the upstream or the downstream of existing canals. We can use differences in differences across upstream and downstream farmers to assess changes associated with irrigation and randomized timing of extension to assess changes resulting from irrigation.

"Mozambique - Integrated Growth Poles Project 2016, Impact Evaluation","The World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) and the World Bank's Global Practice Finance, Innovation and Competitiveness partnered with the Mozambique Integrated Growth Poles Project (IGPP) to assess the impact of the rehabilitation of two feeder roads in Tete province on household welfare. The region is characterized by high agricultural potential growth but suffers from weak market linkages, which could be improved through upgraded market access roads.  After the IGPP’s technical and economic assessment, the roads R604 and R605 crossing Angonia, Tsangano, Chiuta, Macanga districts were given priority for the investment and rehabilitation. From October 2017 to July 2019, a total of 104 km of road R605  and 104 km of road R604 were rehabilitated, including the sealing of 32 and 26 kilometers of paved roads respectively. The maintenance works by the contractor continued on the two roads to maintain all weather road access up until April 2020. <br><br>The IGPP was a 6-year World Bank financed project (Cr 5237-MZ) amounting to SDR 66,100,000 (US$100 million equivalent), on April 25, 2013 and became effective on August 23, 2013. It lasted until April 2020. <br><br>The impact assessment on the effects of the roads rehabilitation included three data collections from 2016 to 2019. The baseline survey was conducted from April to June 2016 on a sample of about 3,000 households in 150 rural communities (~20 households per community).

Ukraine - Post-Distribution Monitoring of Cash-Based Intervention 2020,"UNHCR conducts post-distribution monitoring (PDM) on a regular basis for assistance activities in order to deepen its understanding of the impact these activities have on the persons the organization assists and provides protection to. <br><br>In Ukraine, UNHCR provides individual protection assistance in the following regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Zakarpattya (also covers Lviv) and Kharkiv regions. The UNHCR Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) support only vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers. The type of assistance vary depending on the needs and vulnerability of persons of concern. <br>the following types of CBI assistance that were provided to refugees and asylum-seekers by UNHCR and its Partners in Ukraine in 2020: <br>1. Supplementary assistance and newcomers' assistance <br>- Modality: voucher (Metro cards, a supermarket chain that partners with UNHCR)<br>- Available only in Kyiv and Odesa <br>- Description: Distribution of vouchers (Metro cards) for food and non-food items to refugees and asylum-seekers who meet established vulnerability criteria (newcomers, PoCs in need of supplementary food or hygiene due to medical condition). In 2020, 121 families residing in Kyiv and Odesa received voucher assistance at least once. <br><br>In 2020 UNHCR used Metro Cash&Carry (big supermarket chain) cards in the value of 500 UAH.

"Sudan - High Frequency Phone Survey COVID-19, 2020-2022","Like the rest of the world, Sudan has been experiencing the unprecedented social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. From restrictions on movement to school closures and lockdowns, the economic situation worsened, and commodity prices soared across the country. Results from the first six rounds of the High-Frequency Phone survey indicated that household welfare was negatively affected. The situation led to the loss of employment and income, decreased access to essential commodities and services, and food insecurity, particularly among the poor and vulnerable Sudanese. Moreover, the inability to access food and medicine degraded in July/August 2021 despite a slight amelioration in February/April 2021.<br><br>After COVID-19 in 2020, Sudan experienced situations that are more likely to compromise the recovery process. Political instability, unrest, and protests occurred before and after the military takeover in October 2021. Meanwhile, Sudan Central Bank devalued the currency, which may increase the already high commodities price. Besides, Sudan encountered historic flooding since the onset of the rainy season between May and June 2022. To monitor and assess the dynamics of the impacts of the country's economic and political situation (high inflation, social unrest, food shortages, asset loss, displacement, etc.) on households' welfare, another round of the Sudan High-Frequency Phone survey took place in June to August 2022. <br><br>Similar to the six previous rounds, the survey was conducted using mobile phones and covered all 18 states of Sudan. Round 7 sample is composed of 2816 Households from both urban and rural areas of Sudan. This sample allows us to draw statistical inferences about the Sudanese population at the national and rural/urban levels. The risk of nonresponse was a concern, so efforts were made to minimize this risk, including follow-up with respondents who failed to respond and keep the interviews short (15–20 minutes) to reduce respondent fatigue. <br><br>The questions are similar to the previous six rounds of the High-Frequency Phone survey but with added context. Households are asked about the key channels through which individuals and households are expected to be affected by the exchange rate distortions, country political instability, or flooding that occurred in May/June 2022, as well as how they have recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Furthermore, questions cover a range of topics/themes including, but not limited to, health conditions, access to health facilities, access to other social services, availability of common food and non-food items (including medicines), nutrition and food security, employment/labor, income, assets, coping strategies, remittances, subjective welfare, climate/weather events, and the safety nets assistance.",0061762,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Kyrgyz Republic - Post-Distribution Monitoring of Cash-Based Intervention, February 2021","THE CBI PDM Household Survey was conducted in Kyrgyzstan between February, to April, 2021. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its far lasting financial impacts, UNHCR Kyrgyzstan has rolled out an Emergency Cash Assistance Program to help refugees meet their basic needs and to mitigate harsh socio-economic impacts in the time of crisis and countrywide lockdowns. The CBI was rolled out in two rounds to all refugee and asylum seeker households to help meet their basic needs including food, rent, and access to essential supplies and services during Covid-19 restrictions. <br><br>UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.",0061670,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

It was coordinated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) with support from World Food Programme (WFP), International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Kenya Red Cross (KRC). The survey used SMART methodology and UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2 (2013) for implementation. While previous surveys indicated a steady decline in GAM prevalence between April 2010 and November 2014. There was a considerable increase in GAM prevalence in Kakuma from November 2015 and 2016. Though the difference was not statistically significant. However, in 2017 there has been a significant reduction in GAM prevalence in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei. There has also been a significant change in stunting for Kalobeyei, the same reduction was observed for Kakuma where stunting prevalence has reduced to below the 40% threshold of public health significance. Anaemia in children 6-59 months remains above the 40% threshold of public health significance for both survey areas but anaemia in women, 15-59 years was below 40%. A slight increase was observed in Kakuma while a reduction was observed in Kalobeyei. The November 2017 survey also shows an improvement in Vitamin A supplementation coverage, and water availability. Mosquito net ownership reduced for Kakuma and increased slightly in Kalobeyei. Mosquito net coverage for Kalobeyei remains far below the recommended 80% UNHCR target.",0061663,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nepal - Food and Nutrition Security Enhancement Project Impact Evaluation 2021 - Baseline Survey,"The Food and Nutrition Security Enhancement Project (FANSEP) aims to improve agricultural productivity and nutrition practices of targeted smallholder farmers in Nepal. The project represents a second investment by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) in Nepal, following the recently completed Agriculture and Food Security Project (AFSP). FANSEP covers a new set of areas not reached by AFSP and aims to build on the successes made by AFSP, tailoring project interventions to the populations where they are most successful. In contrast to AFSP, smallholder productivity support will be explicitly targeted to poorer households while others will be eligible for more commercially oriented support directed to producer associations.<br><br>FANSEP is being implemented in hill and Terai (plains) agro-ecological zones. The project will be implemented over five years (2018-2023) in a total of 16 rural municipalities (Gaupalikas) of eight districts spanning three provinces. These districts are Dhanusa, Mahottari, Siraha, and Saptari from Province 2, Dhading, Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk from Bagmati Province, and Gorkha from Gandaki Province. The project aims to improve the livelihoods of crop and livestock farmers, women engaged in household and kitchen garden production, and pregnant and nursing women.<br><br>The project consists of the following complementary components:<br>(a) Technology Adaptation and Dissemination<br>(b) Income Generation and Diversification through Market Access and Climate Risk Management<br>(c) Improving Nutrition Security<br>(d) Project Management, Communication and Monitoring and Evaluation<br><br>Component A focuses on improving productivity and post-harvest management of crops and livestock by promoting introduction of appropriate technologies through improved extension services, including Farmer Field Schools (FFS). In relation to this component, the IE aims to test the overall effectiveness of the project in improving smallholder’s income and nutrition as well as comparing types of interventions within the component side by side to measure relative effectiveness.<br><br>Component B aims to diversify income generation of targeted smallholders by increasing resilience to climate and natural disaster shocks, improving competitiveness and reducing transaction costs by investing in market infrastructure and building market linkages. This will be achieved through two main avenues: firstly, organizing/strengthening producer groups and enhancing their capacities for leadership, decision-making, risk-management, book keeping, and preparation of simple business plans (among other skills). Second, market linkages will be created through Productive Alliances (PAs) between producer organizations and private agribusiness firms (such as agro-vet, traders, commercial farms, MSMEs). This will involve a sort of “business school” as well as provision of matching grants.<br><br>Component C aims to address underlying causes of malnutrition by making the system responsive to these causes and promoting adequate, safe, diversified, and nutrient-rich food. The project will support a set of activities at community and local government level, building on experience from AFSP to strengthen institutional capacity and implement Nutrition Field Schools (NFS) and home nutrition gardens. NFS will follow a theory of behavior change, using skill-based nutrition education over the course of a two-year period per group, including sessions on identification of locally available nutrient-dense foods, cooking demonstrations, food safety, home nutrition gardens, and hygiene education. The target group for the NFS will be existing mothers’ groups, the Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHV), 1000 days women, and other influencers/change agents. A complementary package of Information Education and Communication (IEC) materials will be disseminated on various media platforms. The IE will work with the operational team to track FIES and other food security indicators at the household level.<br><br>Research questions<br>The proposed research questions look to inform project targeting and delivery, and to measure impacts as they relate to the Project Development Outcomes and relevant Results Framework indicators. The most important driver for the questions were priorities from the government perspective and key areas for learning. An additional consideration for the design of the questions was key gaps in the literature, with a view towards informing the larger community of practice within the GAFSP portfolio and across implementing institutions. <br>Overall Question: What is the impact of the FANSEP on the most food insecure and vulnerable households in a community? Additional research questions are:<br>- Does a Proxy Means Test developed using algorithms based on previous IE data successfully identify and target the most food insecure and/or marginalized households in a community? - Targeting Effect<br>- What extension model and which specific interventions deliver take-up of and changes in agricultural and livestock practices in the most efficient manner? - Comparative Effect<br>- Does an intensive Nutrition Field School in addition to household involvement in component A interventions, have a larger impact on improving dietary diversity and FIES score than receiving one component alone? - Complementary Effect",0060860,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
"Nigeria - Incidence of Severe Acute Malnutrition After Treatment: A Prospective Matched Cohort Study in Sokoto, Nigeria 2018-2019","---------------<br>Background<br>---------------<br>Acute malnutrition is an important concern for children aged under 5 years, both globally and in Nigeria. Since the 2000s and the advent of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF), Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) has been commonly addressed through the WHO-recommended approach of Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). CMAM programs provide treatment for children aged 6-59 months through an outpatient therapeutic program (OTP) service for uncomplicated cases and an inpatient service for complicated cases. <br><br>In Nigeria, children are admitted and discharged from the CMAM program using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) as the main criterion. Children with a MUAC <115 mm and no apparent health complications are admitted into the OTP.<br><br>CMAM is evidently effective in resolving SAM. However, evidence exists that children who have gone through an episode of SAM remain at higher risk of morbidity and mortality than children who have not. The evidence on SAM relapse is sparse with a high variation in estimates in the literature due to both contextual and methodological differences. This makes it difficult to understand the persistent risk of a SAM episode after initial recovery from the CMAM program, as well as the associated risk factors. Another important gap in the literature is the absence of comparison groups, making it difficult to determine the excess risk for SAM associated with a recent SAM episode.<br><br>------------------------<br>Research objectives<br>------------------------<br>The primary objective of this study was to assess the persistent and excess risk of SAM among children treated by the CMAM program. <br>·	The persistent risk was assessed by measuring the 6-month incidence rate of relapse into SAM among children discharged as cured from the OTP services of the CMAM program. <br>·	Excess risk was assessed by comparing this rate of relapse to the 6-month incidence rate of SAM in a cohort of community controls. <br>Our secondary objective was to identify factors that are associated with the risk of relapse.<br><br>----------<br>Methods<br>----------<br>We conducted a prospective matched cohort study that tracked 553 children who were discharged as cured from OTP and 526 community control children in Sokoto State, Northern Nigeria. Data were collected from September 2018 to May 2019. OTP-cured children were recruited from the health facilities at discharge from OTP. Control children were recruited in the same communities the OTP-cured children lived in. Outcomes and potential risk factors were measured in up to 12 fortnightly home visits, i.e. in a period of up to six months for each child.<br><br>This cohort study was implemented in several phases that took place sequentially, and that included recruitment of OTP-cured children, recruitment of community control children, first home visit (to collect baseline characteristics), and subsequent follow-up home visits. At each phase, different questionnaires were administered.",0060697,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Kenya - Evaluation of the Hunger Safety Net Programme Phase 3: COVID-19 Cash Transfer 2020-2021,"To support the urban poor during the COVID-19 crisis, the UK government provided a monthly Cash Transfer (CT) of 4,000 Kenyan Shillings (KSH) (or £27) to approximately 52,000 vulnerable people living in informal settlements in Nairobi and Mombasa over a period of three months. The COVID-19 CT was implemented by a consortium led by GiveDirectly, and the monthly stipend was paid using mobile money transfers, with the first transfers taking place from October 2020. The CT was designed to support beneficiaries to buy food or meet other high-priority needs-such as purchasing water, paying for medical care, or making rent payments as well as to reduce the use of negative coping strategies (e.g., selling assets, borrowing money).<br><br>OPM was contracted to conduct the monitoring and evaluation of the COVID-19 CT. The main objective of this evaluation was to determine whether, and to what extent, the emergency COVID-19 CT had a positive effect on its target population in informal urban settlements in Kenya. The evaluation also provided an assessment of the implementation parameters and mechanisms adopted as part of the design and delivery of the COVID-19 CT. <br><br>To fulfil these aims, the evaluation was structured around two separate components-an impact evaluation and a process review-and drew on multiple research methods through a mixed methods research framework. The objective of the quantitative impact evaluation was to assess whether the COVID-19 CT has had an impact on its beneficiaries, and to quantify the scale of any effect detected. This estimation of impact was based on a longitudinal non-experimental design, focusing on a panel of beneficiaries interviewed at three points in time (baseline - prior to the intervention, midline, and endline - post-intervention) over the course of the implementation period. All quantitative data collection took place remotely using Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) software.",0060694,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Rwanda - Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project Impact Evaluation 2016","Agriculture is a major engine of the Rwandan economy and remains a priority sector in the Government of Rwanda's goals of reducing poverty and achieving food security through commercialized agriculture. Sustainable improvements to agricultural productivity is the only way to achieve this target, calling for investments in participatory land management, water harvesting and intensified irrigation of the hillsides. The Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) project has been working to meet these goals.<br><br>Evaluating the overall impact of LWH is important to allow Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRIs) to effectively plan for its future activities. LWH covers a relatively small area of 30,250 ha, eventually affecting approximately 20 watersheds. From the perspective of MINAGRI, LWH can be seen as a pilot program for comprehensive agricultural overhaul. LWH includes major infrastructure investments such as hillside terracing, irrigation dams, and post-harvest storage. The project aims to operationalize MINAGRIs strategy to encourage mono cropping of cash crops, as opposed to the traditional system of inter-cropping for household consumption.<br><br>LWH has been rolled out in three phases: implementation in the four Phase 1A sites began in 2010, in the three Phase 1B sites in 2012, and in the Phase 1C sites in late 2013. <br><br>There have been five surveys for this project including baselines and four follow-ups.

Philippines - National Demographic and Health Survey 2008,"The 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey (2008 NDHS) is a nationally representa­tive survey of 13,594 women age 15-49 from 12,469 households successfully interviewed, covering 794 enumeration areas (clusters) throughout the Philippines. This survey is the ninth in a series of demographic and health sur­veys conducted to assess the demographic and health situation in the country. The survey obtained detailed information on fertility levels, marriage, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women and young children, childhood mortality, maternal and child health, and knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Also, for the first time, the Philippines NDHS gathered information on violence against women. <br><br>The 2008 NDHS was conducted by the Phil­ippine National Statistics Office (NSO). Techni­cal assistance was provided by ICF Macro through the MEASURE DHS program. Funding for the survey was mainly provided by the Gov­ernment of the Philippines. Financial support for some preparatory and processing phases of the survey was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). <br><br>Like previous Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in the Philippines, the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) was primarily designed to provide information on population, family planning, and health to be used in evaluating and designing policies, programs, and strategies for improving health and family planning services in the country. The 2008 NDHS also included questions on domestic violence. Specifically, the 2008 NDHS had the following objectives:  <br><br>- Collect data at the national level that will allow the estimation of demographic rates, particularly, fertility rates by urban-rural residence and region, and under-five mortality rates at the national level. <br>- Analyze the direct and indirect factors which determine the levels and patterns of fertility.  <br>- Measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice by method, urban-rural residence, and region. <br>- Collect data on family health: immunizations, prenatal and postnatal checkups, assistance at delivery, breastfeeding, and prevalence and treatment of diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections among children under five years.  <br>- Collect data on environmental health, utilization of health facilities, prevalence of common non­communicable and infectious diseases, and membership in health insurance plans. <br>- Collect data on awareness of tuberculosis. <br>- Determine women's knowledge about HIV/AIDS and access to HIV testing. <br>- Determine the extent of violence against women. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Levels and Trends. There has been a steady decline in fertility in the Philippines in the past 36 years. From 6.0 children per woman in 1970, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the Phil­ippines declined to 3.3 children per woman in 2006. The current fertility level in the country is relatively high compared with other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, where the TFR is below 2 children per woman. <br><br>Fertility Differentials. Fertility varies substan­tially across subgroups of women. Urban women have, on average, 2.8 children compared with 3.8 children per woman in rural areas. The level of fer­tility has a negative relationship with education; the fertility rate of women who have attended college (2.3 children per woman) is about half that of women who have been to elementary school (4.5 children per woman). Fertility also decreases with household wealth: women in wealthier households have fewer children than those in poorer households. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Knowledge of Contraception. Knowledge of family planning is universal in the Philippines- almost all women know at least one method of fam-ily planning. At least 90 percent of currently married women have heard of the pill, male condoms, injectables, and female sterilization, while 87 percent know about the IUD and 68 percent know about male sterilization. On aver­age, currently married women know eight meth­ods of family planning. <br><br>Unmet Need for Family Planning. Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of currently married women who either do not want any more children or want to wait before having their next birth, but are not using any method of family planning. The 2008 NDHS data show that the total unmet need for family planning in the Philip­pines is 22 percent, of which 13 percent is limiting and 9 percent is for spacing. The level of unmet need has increased from 17 percent in 2003. <br><br>Overall, the total demand for family planning in the Philippines is 73 percent, of which 69 percent has been satisfied. If all of need were satisfied, a contraceptive prevalence rate of about 73 percent could, theoretically, be expected. Comparison with the 2003 NDHS indicates that the percentage of de­mand satisfied has declined from 75 percent. <br><br>MATERNAL HEALTH <br><br>Antenatal Care. Nine in ten Filipino mothers received some antenatal care (ANC) from a medical professional, either a nurse or midwife (52 percent) or a doctor (39 percent). Most women have at least four antenatal care visits. More than half (54 per­cent) of women had an antenatal care visit during the first trimester of pregnancy, as recommended. While more than 90 percent of women who received ante­natal care had their blood pressure monitored and weight measured, only 54 percent had their urine sample taken and 47 percent had their blood sample taken. About seven in ten women were informed of pregnancy complications. Three in four births in the Philippines are protected against neonatal tetanus.  <br><br>Delivery and Postnatal Care. Only 44 per­cent of births in the Philippines occur in health facilities-27 percent in a public facility and 18 percent in a private facility. More than half (56 percent) of births are still delivered at home. Sixty-two percent of births are assisted by a health professional-35 percent by a doctor and 27 percent by a midwife or nurse. Thirty-six percent are assisted by a traditional birth atten­dant or hilot. About 10 percent of births are de­livered by C-section.  <br><br>The Department of Health (DOH) recom­mends that mothers receive a postpartum check within 48 hours of delivery. A majority of women (77 percent) had a postnatal checkup within two days of delivery; 14 percent had a postnatal checkup 3 to 41 days after delivery. <br><br>CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Childhood Mortality. Childhood mortality continues to decline in the Philippines. Cur­rently, about one in every 30 children in the Philippines dies before his or her fifth birthday. The infant mortality rate for the five years be­fore the survey (roughly 2004-2008) is 25 deaths per 1,000 live births and the under-five mortality rate is 34 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is lower than the rates of 29 and 40 reported in 2003, respectively. The neonatal mortality rate, representing death in the first month of life, is 16 deaths per 1,000 live births. Under-five mortal­ity decreases as household wealth increases; children from the poorest families are three times more likely to die before the age of five as those from the wealthiest families. <br><br>There is a strong association between under-five mortality and mother's education. It ranges from 47 deaths per 1,000 live births among chil­dren of women with elementary education to 18 deaths per 1,000 live births among children of women who attended college. As in the 2003 NDHS, the highest level of under-five mortality is observed in ARMM (94 deaths per 1,000 live births), while the lowest is observed in NCR (24 deaths per 1,000 live births). <br><br>NUTRITION <br><br>Breastfeeding Practices. Eighty-eight percent of children born in the Philippines are breastfed. There has been no change in this practice since 1993. In addition, the median durations of any breastfeeding and of exclusive breastfeeding have remained at 14 months and less than one month, re­spectively. Although it is recommended that infants should not be given anything other than breast milk until six months of age, only one-third of Filipino children under six months are exclusively breastfed. Complementary foods should be in­troduced when a child is six months old to re­duce the risk of malnutrition. More than half of children ages 6-9 months are eating complemen­tary foods in addition to being breastfed. <br><br>The Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) guidelines contain specific recommendations for the number of times that young children in vari­ous age groups should be fed each day as well as the number of food groups from which they should be fed. NDHS data indicate that just over half of children age 6-23 months (55 percent) were fed according to the IYCF guidelines. <br><br>HIV/AIDS <br><br>Awareness of HIV/AIDS. While over 94 percent of women have heard of AIDS, only 53 percent know the two major methods for pre­venting transmission of HIV (using condoms and limiting sex to one uninfected partner). Only 45 percent of young women age 15-49 know these two methods for preventing HIV transmis­sion. Knowledge of prevention methods is higher in urban areas than in rural areas and in­creases dramatically with education and wealth. For example, only 16 percent of women with no education know that using condoms limits the risk of HIV infection compared with 69 percent of those who have attended college.  <br><br>TUBERCULOSIS <br><br>Knowledge of TB. While awareness of tubercu­losis (TB) is high, knowledge of its causes and symptoms is less common. Only 1 in 4 women know that TB is caused by microbes, germs or bacteria. Instead, respondents tend to say that TB is caused by smoking or drinking alcohol, or that it is inherited. Symptoms associated with TB are better recognized. Over half of the respondents cited coughing, while 39 percent mentioned weight loss, 35 percent men­tioned blood in sputum, and 30 percent cited cough­ing with sputum. <br><br>WOMEN'S STATUS <br><br>Women's Status and Employment. Sixty percent of currently married women age 15-49 interviewed in the 2008 NDHS were employed in the year before the survey. Among those who are employed, most earn cash, while 6 percent are unpaid. Most women decide how their earn­ings are spent jointly with their husbands. Only four percent report that mainly their husband decides how their earnings are spent. <br><br>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE <br><br>Spousal Violence. Emotional and other forms of non-personal violence-such as insults, humiliation, and threats of harm-are the most common types of spousal violence: 23 percent of ever-married women report having experienced such violence by their husbands, with 15 percent reporting these types of violence occurred in the year prior to the survey.",0050699,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Zimbabwe - Demographic and Health Survey 1994,"The 1994 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 6,128 women age 15-49 and 2,141 men age 15-54. The ZDHS was implemented by the Central Statistical Office (CSO), with significant technical guidance provided by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOH&CW) and the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC). Macro International Inc. (U.S.A.) provided technical assistance throughout the course of the project in the context of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, while financial assistance was provided by the U.S, Agency for International Development (USAID/Harare). Data collection for the ZDHS was conducted from July to November 1994. <br><br>As in the 1988 ZDHS, the 1994 ZDHS was designed to provide information on levels and trends in fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality, and maternal and child health. How- ever, the 1994 ZDHS went further, collecting data on: compliance with contraceptive pill use, knowledge and behaviours related to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and mortality related to pregnancy and childbearing (i.e., maternal mortality). The ZDHS data are intended for use by programme managers and policymakers to evaluate and improve family planning and health programmes in Zimbabwe. <br><br>The primary objectives of the 1994 ZDHS were to provide up-to-date information on: fertility levels; nuptiality; sexual activity; fertility preferences; awareness and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; nutritional status of mothers and young children; early childhood mortality and maternal mortality; maternal and child health, and awareness and behaviour regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. <br>The 1994 ZDHS is a follow-up of the 1988 ZDHS, also implemented by CSO. While significantly expanded in scope, the 1994 ZDHS provides updated estimates of basic demographic and health indicators covered in the earlier survey. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY<br><br>Survey results show that Zimbabwe has experienced a fairly rapid decline in fertility over the past decade.<br><br>Despite the decline in fertility, childbearing still begins early for many women. One in five women age 15-19 has begun childbearing (i.e., has already given birth or is pregnant with her first child). More than half of women have had a child before age 20. <br><br>Births that occur too soon after a previous birth face higher risks of undemutrition, illness, and death. The 1994 ZDHS indicates that 12 percent of births in Zimbabwe take place less than two years after a prior birth. <br><br>Marriage. The age at which women and men marry has risen slowly over the past 20 years. Nineteen percent of currently married women are in a polygynous union (i.e., their husband has at least one other wife). This represents a small rise in polygyny since the 1988 ZDHS when 17 percent of married women were in polygynous unions. <br><br>Fertility Preferences. Around one-third of both women and men in Zimbabwe want no more children. The survey results show that, of births in the last three years, 1 in 10 was unwanted and in 1 in three was mistimed. If all unwanted births were avoided, the fertility rate in Zimbabwe would fall from 4.3 to 3.5 children per woman. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING<br><br>Knowledge and use of family planning in Zimbabwe has continued to rise over the last several years. The 1994 ZDHS shows that virtually all married women (99 percent) and men (100 percent) were able to cite at least one modem method of contraception. Contraceptive use varies widely among geographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Fifty-eight per- cent of married women in Harare are using a modem method versus 28 percent in Manicaland. Government-sponsored providers remain the chief source of contraceptive methods in Zimbabwe. Survey results show that 15 percent of married women have an unmet need for family planning (either for spacing or limiting births).<br><br>CHILDHOOD MORTALITY<br><br>One of the main objectives of the ZDHS was to document the levels and trends in mortality among children under age five. The 1994 ZDHS results show that child survival prospects have not improved since the late 1980s. The ZDHS results show that childhood mortality is especially high when associated with two factors: short preceding birth interval and low level of maternal education. <br><br>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH<br><br>Utilisation of antenatal services is high in Zimbabwe; in the three years before the survey, mothers received antenatal care for 93 percent of births. About 70 percent of births take place in health facilities; however, this figure varies from around 53 percent in Manicaland and Mashonaland Central to 94 percent in Bulawayo. It is important for the health of both the mother and child that trained medical personnel are available in cases of prolonged or obstructed delivery, which are major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Twenty-four percent of children under age three were reported to have had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey. <br><br>Nutrition. Almost all children (99 percent) are breastfed for some period of time; When food supplementation begins, wide disparity exists in the types of food received by children in different geographic and socioecoaomic groups. Generally, children living in urban areas (Harare and Bulawayo, in particular) and children of more educated women receive protein-rich foods (e.g., meat, eggs, etc.) on a more regular basis than other children. <br><br>AIDS<br><br>AIDS-related Knowledge and Behaviour. All but a fraction of Zimbabwean women and men have heard of AIDS, but the quality of that knowledge is sometimes poor. Condom use and limiting the number of sexual partners were cited most frequently by both women and men as ways to avoid the AIDS Virus. While general knowledge of condoms is nearly universal among both women and men, when asked where they could get a condom, 30 Percent of women and 20 percent of men could not cite a single source.",0050532,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Zimbabwe - Demographic and Health Survey 1999,"The Central Statistical Office (CSO) conducted the third Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) between August and November 1999. The 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) is a nationally represen­tative survey that was implemented by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) from August to November 1999. Although significantly ex­panded in content, the 1999 ZDHS is a follow-on to the 1988 and 1994 ZDHS surveys and provides updated estimates of the basic demo­graphic and health indicators covered in the earlier surveys. The 1999 ZDHS was conducted in all of the ten provinces of Zimbabwe.<br><br>The 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) is one of a series of surveys undertaken by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) as part of the Zimbabwe National Household Survey Capability Programme (ZNHSCP) and the worldwide MEASURE DHS+ programme. The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC), the Department of Population Studies of the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), the National AIDS Coordinating Programme (NACP), and the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOH&CW) contributed significantly to the design, implementation, and analysis of the ZDHS results. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided funds for the implementation of the 1999 ZDHS. Macro International Inc. provided technical assistance through its contract with USAID. UNICEF/Zimbabwe supported the survey by providing additional funds for fieldwork transportation. <br><br>The primary objectives of the 1999 ZDHS were to provide up-to-date information on fertility levels, nuptiality, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of mothers and young children, early childhood mortality and maternal mortality, maternal and child health, and awareness and behaviour regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. <br><br>The 1999 ZDHS is a follow-up of the 1988 and 1994 ZDHS surveys, also implemented by CSO. The 1999 ZDHS is significantly expanded in scope and provides updated estimates of basic demographic and health indicators covered in the earlier surveys. <br><br>KEY RESULTS<br><br>Like the 1988 ZDHS and the 1994 ZDHS, the 1999 ZDHS was designed to provide information on levels and trends in fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality, and maternal and child health. Specific questions were also asked about the respondent's knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the HIV/AIDS virus and other sexu­ally transmitted diseases.  Like the1994 ZDHS, the 1999 ZDHS also collected data on mortality related to pregnancy and childbearing (i.e., maternal mortality). The ZDHS data are in­tended for use by programme managers and policymakers to evaluate and improve family planning and health programmes in Zimbabwe. <br><br>- Fertility. The 1988, 1994, and 1999 ZDHS results show that Zimbabwe continues to experience a fairly rapid decline in fertility. <br>- Marriage. The median age at first marriage in Zimbabwe has risen slowly over the past 30 years. Women age 20-24 marry about one year later than women 40-49 (19.7 years and 18.8 years, respectively). The proportion of women married by age 15 declined from 9 percent among those age 45-49 to 2 percent among women age 15-19 years. <br>- Polygyny. One in six women in Zimbabwe reported being in a polygynous union. <br>- Fertility Preferences.  More than half (53 percent) of the married women in Zimbabwe would like to have another child. <br>- Family Planning. Since 1994, knowl­edge of family planning in Zimbabwe has been universal and has not varied across subgroups of the population. The pill, condoms, and injectables are the most widely known methods. <br>- Antenatal Care.  Utilisation of antenatal services is high in Zimbabwe; in the five years before the survey, mothers received antenatal care from a trained medical professional for 93 percent of their most recent births; 13 percent from a doctor and 80 percent from a trained nurse or a midwife. <br>- Delivery Characteristics. In 1999, the percentage of births delivered in health facilities (72 percent) was slightly higher than the percentage recorded in the 1994 ZDHS (69 per­cent). <br>- Childhood Vaccination. Three in four children 12-23 months have been vaccinated against six diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and measles). Two in three children completed the vaccination sched­ule by the time they turned one year. <br>- Childhood Diseases. In the 1999 ZDHS, mothers were asked whether their children under the age of five years had been ill with a cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing in the two weeks preceding the survey.  <br>- Childhood Mortality.  Data from sur­veys since 1988 indicate that early childhood mortality in Zimbabwe declined until the late 1980s, after which there was stagnation and an upward trend in the past five years.<br>- Adult and Maternal Mortality.  As in 1994, the 1999 ZDHS collected information that allows estimation of adult and maternal mortality. <br>- Perceived Problems in Accessing Women's Health Care.  Women are sometimes perceived to have problems in seeking health care services for themselves. <br>- Nutrition. Breastfeeding is nearly universal in Zimbabwe; 98 percent of the children born in the past five years were breastfed at some time. <br>- AIDS-related Knowledge and Behav­iour. Although practically all Zimbabwean women and men have heard of AIDS, the quality of that knowledge is sometimes poor; 17 percent of women and 7 percent of men could not cite a single means to avoid getting HIV/AIDS.",0050530,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Zimbabwe - Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014,"The Zimbabwe Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was conducted between February and April in 2014 by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT). Technical and financial support for the survey was coordinated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).<br><br>The MICS is designed to provide statistically sound and internationally comparable data essential for developing evidence-based policies and programmes and for monitoring progress towards national goals and global commitments, to enhance the welfare of women and children. Among these global commitments are those emanating from the World Fit for Children Declaration and Plan of Action, the goals of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS), the Education for All Declaration (EFA) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Zimbabwe MICS 2014 results are critical for final MDG reporting in 2015, and are expected to form part of the baseline data for the post-2015 era. The MICS plays a critical role in informing national policies such as the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimASSET) October 2013 to December 2018. The study covers the following areas: sample and survey methodology, sample coverage and the characteristics of households and respondents, child mortality, child nutrition, child health, water and sanitation, reproductive health, early childhood development, literacy and education, child protection, HIV and sexual behaviour, mass media and information and communication technology, and tobacco and alcohol use.<br><br>The Zimbabwe MICS is a nationally representative survey of 17,047 households, comprising 14,408 women in the 15-49 years age group, 7,914 men age 15-54 years and 10,223 children under 5 years of age.

Zambia - Demographic and Health Survey 1992,"The 1992 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) was a nationally representative sample survey of women age 15-49. The survey was designed to provide information onlevels and trends of fertility, infant and child mortality, family planning knowledge and use, and maternal and child health. The ZDHS was carried out by the University of Zambia in collaboration with Central Statistical Office and the Ministry of Health. Fieldwork was conducted from mid-January to mid-May 1992, during which time, over 6000 households and 7000 women were interviewed. <br><br>The primary objectives of the ZDHS are: <br>- To collect up-to-date information on fertility, infant and child mortality and family planning;<br>- To collect information on health-related matters such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children's immunizations and childhood diseases;<br>- To assess the nutritional status of mothers and children;<br>- To support dissemination and utilisation of the results in planning, managing and improving family planning and health services in the country; and<br>- To enhance the survey capabilities of the institutions Involved in order to facilitate the implementation of surveys of this type in the future.<br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Results imply that fertility in Zambia has been declining over the past decade or so; at current levels, Zambian women will give birth to an average of 6.5 children during their reproductive years. <br><br>- Contraceptive knowledge is nearly universal in Zambia; over 90 percent of married women reported knowing about at least one modern contraceptive method.Over half of women using modern methods obtained them from government sources. <br><br>- Women in Zambia am marrying somewhat later than they did previously. The median age at marriage has increased from 17 years or under among women now in their 30s and 40s to 18 years or older among women in their 20s. Women with secondary education marry three years later (19.9) than women with no education (16.7). <br><br>- Over one-fifth (22 percent) of currently married women do not want to have any more children.<br><br>- One of the most striking findings from the ZDHS is the high level of child mortality and its apparent increase in recent years. <br><br>- Information on various aspects of maternal and child healtlr--antenatal care, vaccinations, bmastfeeding and food supplementation, and illness---was collected in the ZDHS on births in the five years preceding the survey. <br><br>- ZDHS data indic ate that haft of the births in Zambia are delivered at home and half in health facilities. <br><br>- Based on information obtained from health cards and mothers' reports, 95 percent of children age 12- 23 months are vaccinated against tuberculosis, 94 percent have received at least one dose of DPT and polio vaccines, and 77 percent have been vaccinated against measles. Sixty-seven percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully immunised and only 4 percent have not received any immuhisations. <br><br>- Almost all children in Zambia (98 percent) are breastfed. The median duration of breasffeeding is relatively long (19 months), but supplemental liquids and foods are introduced at an early age. By age 2-3 months, half of all children are being given supplementary food or liquid. <br><br>- ZDHS data indicate that undemutrition is an obstacle to improving child health; 40 percent of children under age five are stunted or short for their age, compared to an international reference population. Five percent of children are wasted or thin for their height and 25 percent are underweight for their age. <br><br>- The ZDHS included several questions about knowledge of AIDS. Almost all respondents (99 percent) had heard of AIDS and the vast majority (90 percent) knew that AIDS is transmitted through sexual intercourse.<br><br>The implementation of all these aspects of the PHC programmes requires multi-sectoral action and close collaboration among the various govemment institutions. The Govemment has therefore set up multi- sectoral PHC committees as an integral part of the PHC basic supportive manpower and inter-sectoral collaboration with other ministries has been given prominence.",0050505,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Zambia - Demographic and Health Survey 1996,"The 1996 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) is a nationally representative survey conducted by the Central Statistical Office at the request of the Ministry of Health, with the aim of gathering reliable information on fertility, childhood and maternal mortality rates, maternal and child health indicators, contraceptive knowledge and use, and knowledge and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including AIDS. The survey is a follow-up to the Zambia DHS survey carried out in 1992.<br><br>The primary objectives of the ZDHS are: <br>- To collect up-to-date information on fertility, infant and child mortality and family planning;<br>- To collect information on health-related matters such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children's immunisations and childhood diseases;<br>- To assess the nutritional status of mothers and children; iv) To support dissemination and utilisation of the results in planning, managing and improving family planning and health services in the country; and<br>- To enhance the survey capabilities of the institutions involved in order to facilitate the implementation of surveys of this type in the future.<br><br>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>- Fertility Trends. The 1996 ZDHS survey results indicate that the level of fertility in Zambia is continuing to decline. <br>- Fertility Differentials. Some women are apparently leading the fertility decline. Moreover, women who have received some secondary education have the lowest level of fertility. <br>- Age at First Birth. Childbearing begins early in Zambia, with over one-third of women becoming mothers by the time they reach age 18 and around two-thirds having had a child by the time they reach age 20. <br>- Birth Intervals. The majority of Zambian children (81 percent) are born after a ""safe"" birth interval (24 or more months apart), with 36 percent born at least 36 months after a prior birth. Nevertheless, 19 percent of non-first births occur less than 24 months after the preceding birth. The overall median birth interval is 32 months. <br>- Fertility Preferences. Survey data indicate that there is a strong desire for children and a preference for large families in Zambian society. <br>- Unplanned Fertility. Despite the increasing level of contraceptive use, ZDHS data indicate that unplanned pregnancies are still common. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>- Increasing Use of Contraception. The contraceptive prevalence rate in Zambia has increased significantly over the past five years, rising from 15 percent in 1992 to 26 percent in 1996. <br>- Differentials in Family Planning Use. Differentials in current use of family planning by province are large. <br>- Source of Contraception. Six in ten users obtain their methods from public sources, while 24 percent use non-governmental medical sources and shops and friends account for the remaining 13 percent. Government health centres (41 percent) and government hospitals (16 percent) are the most common sources of contraceptive methods. <br>- Knowledge of Contraceptive Methods. Knowledge of contraceptive methods is nearly universal, with 96 percent of all women and men knowing at least one method of family planning. <br>- Family Planning Messages. One reason for the increase in level of contraceptive awareness is that family planning messages are prevalent. <br>- Unmet Need for Family Planning. ZDHS data show that there is a considerable unmet need for family planning services in Zambia. <br><br>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH <br><br>- Maternal Health Care. ZDHS data show some encouraging results regarding maternal health care, as well as to some areas in which improvements could be made. Results show that most Zambian mothers receive antenatal care, 3 percent from a doctor and 93 percent from a nurse or trained midwife. <br>- High Childhood Mortality. One of the more disturbing findings from the survey is that child survival has not improved over the past few years. <br>- Childhood Vaccination Coverage. Vaccination coverage against the most common childhood illnesses has increased recently. <br>- Childhood Health. ZDHS data indicate that Zambian mothers are reasonably well-informed about childhood illnesses and that a high proportion are treated appropriately. <br>- Breastfeeding Practices. The ZDHS results indicate that breastfeeding is almost universally practised in Zambia, with a median duration of 20 months. <br>- Knowledge and Behaviour Regarding AIDS. Survey results indicate that virtually all respondents had heard of AIDS. Common sources of information were friends/relatives, the radio, and health workers. The vast majority of respondents--80 percent of women and 94 percent of men--say they have changed their behaviour in order to avoid contracting AIDS, mostly by restricting themselves to one sexual partner.",0050503,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Viet Nam - Socio-economics of Pesticide Use 2003,"A survey of Vietnamese farmers was carried out by the Research Department of the World Bank in the winter of 2003. Structured questionnaires were used to collect information on farming systems, pesticide use and practices, applicator precautions/averting behavior and health/ environmental effects. The main geographical area of interest is the Mekong Delta. The survey was divided into two major sections, one dealing with the socio-economics of pesticide use (e.g. production, pesticides used, protection, training, etc.) and another strictly dealing with the health of the farmer (e.g. questions on self-reported health ailments/ health-related habits, a general physical exam, and patch-skin and blood tests for pesticides). The survey was constructed by the World Bank team in collaboration with the University of Economics in Ho Chi Minh City (for socio-economic portion of the survey) and the Centre of Occupational and Environmental Health (COEH) of the Vietnam Association of Occupational Health (VINOH) for the medical survey. Each of these World Bank counterparts was responsible for the implementation of the survey.

Viet Nam - Health Effects of Pesticide Use 2003,"Background<br>The health impacts of pesticides are difficult to assess from available secondary data in most countries. Pesticide poisonings documented by health centers represent only a small fraction of actual poisonings, for two main reasons. First, only a small number of severe poisonings (mostly suicide attempts) are treated in the health care system. Many agricultural workers do not report non-lethal cases because of the cost in time or money, inaccessibility of health care services, or fear that drawing attention to themselves may result in the loss of their job. Secondly, the relatively few farmers who do seek treatment are often misdiagnosed because pesticide poisonings can mimic other common health problems (FAO, 2001). The World Health Organization estimates that there are 50 cases of poisoning for every case reported and registered (WHO, 1990).<br><br>Survey Design<br>To assess the actual extent of this problem, the World Bank collaborated with the Vietnam Association of Occupational Health to study pesticide poisoning among Mekong Delta farmers in the first quarter of 2004. With 481 farmers participating, the study collected both survey and clinical data. Structured questionnaires were used to collect information on farming systems, pesticide use and practices, applicator precautions, protective measures, and self-reported poisoning symptoms. The survey was designed by the World Bank team in collaboration with the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City and the Vietnam Association of Occupational Health. All participating farmers were examined by the doctors from the Vietnam Association of Occupational Health. Using clinical exam results and self-reported symptoms, the study team selected potentially-poisoned farmers for blood tests that detect acute or chronic contamination by pesticides (organophosphates and carbamates).<br>The medical survey covered the districts of An Phu and Chau Thanh (An Giang province), Thot Not and Vi Thanh (Can Tho province), Tan Thanh and Thu Thua (Long An province ), Cai Lay and Cho Gao (Tien Giang province), and Tra Cu and Tieu Can (Tra Vinh province) in the Mekong Delta. The 482 surveyed farmers are almost all male (3 females were examined). Their ages range from 15 to 70 years, with an average age of 39. The surveyed farmers average 8 years of education; 74% report that they smoke and 48% report drinking alcoholic beverages. To minimize possible reporting bias, the surveyed farmers were assured of anonymity.",0050434,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
"Viet Nam - WSP Global Scaling up Handwashing Behavior Impact Evaluation, Baseline and Endline Surveys 2009-2011","In December 2006, in response to the preventable threats posed by poor sanitation and hygiene, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) launched Global Scaling Up Handwashing and Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation1 to improve the health and welfare outcomes for millions of poor people. Local and national governments implement these large-scale projects with technical support from WSP. Handwashing with soap at critical times-such as after contact with feces and before handling food-has been shown to substantially reduce the incidence of diarrhea. It reduces health risks even when families do not have access to basic sanitation and water supply. Despite this benefit, rates of handwashing with soap at critical times are very low throughout the developing world. Global Scaling Up Handwashing aims to test whether handwashing with soap behavior can be generated and sustained among the poor and vulnerable using innovative promotional approaches. The goal of Global Scaling Up Handwashing is to reduce the risk of diarrhea and therefore increase household productivity by stimulating and sustaining the behavior of handwashing with soap at critical times in the lives of 5.4 million people in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam, where the project has been implemented to date.<br><br>In an effort to induce improved handwashing behavior, the intervention borrows from both commercial and social marketing fields. This entails the design of communications campaigns and messages likely to bring about desired behavior changes and delivering them strategically so that the target audiences are “surrounded” by handwashing promotion via multiple channels. One of the handwashing project's global objectives is to learn about and document the long-term health and welfare impacts of the project intervention. To measure magnitude of these impacts, the project is implementing a randomized-controlled impact evaluation (IE) in each of the four countries to establish causal linkages between the intervention and key outcomes. The IE uses household surveys to gather data on characteristics of the population exposed to the intervention and to track changes in key outcomes that can be causally attributed to the intervention.<br><br>The objective of the IE is to assess the effects of the handwashing project on individual-level handwashing behavior and practices of caregivers. By introducing exogenous variation in handwashing promotion (through randomized exposure to the project), the IE will also address important issues related to the effect of intended behavioral change on child development outcomes. In particular, it will provide information on the extent to which improved handwashing behavior contributes to child health and welfare.<br><br>The primary hypothesis of the study is that improved handwashing behavior leads to reductions in disease incidence, and results in direct and indirect health, developmental, and economic benefits by breaking the fecal-oral transmission route. The IE aims to address the following research questions and associated hypotheses:<br><br>1. What is the effect of handwashing promotion on handwashing behavior?<br>2. What is the effect of improved handwashing behavior on health and welfare?<br>3. Which promotion strategies are more cost-effective in achieving desired outcomes?<br><br>(The above excerpt is taken from: Scaling Up Handwashing Behavior: Findings from the Impact Evaluation Baseline Survey in Vietnam Claire Chase and Quy-Toan Do November 2010)<br><br>The report is attached.",0050428,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Vanuatu - Recognised Seasonal Employer Program Impact Evaluation 2007-2010,"Seasonal migration programs are widely used around the world, yet there is little evidence as to their development impacts. A multi-year prospective evaluation of New Zealand's Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) worker program was designed to measure the impact of participating in this program on households in Tonga and Vanuatu.

Uzbekistan - Demographic and Health Survey 1996,"The 1996 Uzbekistan Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 4,415 women age 15-49. Fieldwork was conducted from June to October 1996. The UDHS was sponsored by the Ministry of Health (MOH), and was funded by the United States Agency for International Development. The Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology implemented the survey with technical assistance from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program. <br><br>The 1996 UDHS was the first national-level population and health survey in Uzbekistan. It was implemented by the Research Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan. The 1996 UDHS was funded by the United States Agency for International development (USAID) and technical assistance was provided by Macro International Inc. (Calverton, Maryland USA) through its contract with USAID.<br><br>OBJECTIVES AND ORGANIZATION OF THE SURVEY <br><br>The purpose of the 1996 Uzbekistan Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was to provide an information base to the Ministry of Health for the planning of policies and programs regarding the health of women and their children. The UDHS collected data on women's reproductive histories, knowledge and use of contraception, breastfeeding practices, and the nutrition, vaccination coverage, and episodes of illness among children under the age of three. The survey also included, for all women of reproductive age and for children under the age of three, the measurement of the hemoglobin level in the blood to assess the prevalence of anemia and measurements of height and weight to assess nutritional status. <br><br>A secondary objective of the survey was to enhance the capabilities of institutions in Uzbekistan to collect, process and analyze population and health data so as to facilitate the implementation of future surveys of this type. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Fertility Rates. Survey results indicate a total fertility rate (TFR) for all of Uzbekistan of 3.3 children per woman. Fertility levels differ for different population groups. The TFR for women living in urbml areas (2.7 children per woman) is substantially lower than for women living in rural areas (3.7). The TFR for Uzbeki women (3.5 children per woman) is higher than for women of other ethnicities (2.5). Among the regions of Uzbekistan, the TFR is lowest in Tashkent City (2.3 children per woman). <br>- Family Planning. Knowledge. Knowledge of contraceptive methods is high among women in Uzbekistan. Knowledge of at least one method is 89 percent. High levels of knowledge are the norm for women of all ages, all regions of the country, all educational levels, and all ethnicities. However, knowledge of sterilization was low; only 27 percent of women reported knowing of this method. <br>- Fertility Preferences. A majority of women in Uzbekistan (51 percent) indicated that they desire no more children. Among women age 30 and above, the proportion that want no more children increases to 75 percent. Thus, many women come to the preference to stop childbearing at relatively young ages when they have 20 or more potential years of childbearing ahead of them. For some of these women, the most appropriate method of contraception may be a long-acting method such as female sterilization, However, there is a deficiency of both knowledge and use of this method in Uzbekistan. In the interest of providing couples with a broad choice of safe and effective methods, information about this method and access to it should be made available so that informed choices about its suitability can be made by individual women and couples. <br>- Induced Aboration : Abortion Rates. From the UDHS data, the total abortion rate (TAR)--the number of abortions a woman will have in her lifetime based on the currently prevailing abortion rates--was calculated. For Uzbekistan, the TAR for the period from mid-1993 to mid-1996 is 0.7 abortions per woman. As expected, the TAR for Uzbekistan is substantially lower than recent estimates of the TAR for other areas of the former Soviet Union such as Kazakstan (1.8), Romania (3.4 abortions per woman), and Yekaterinburg and Perm in Russia (2.3 and 2.8, respectively). <br>- Infant mortality : In the UDHS, infant mortality data were collected based on the international definition of a live birth which, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, is a birth that breathes or shows any sign of life (United Nations, 1992). <br>- Mortality Rates. For the five-year period before the survey (i.e., approximately mid- 1992 to mid- 1996), infant mortality in Uzbekistan is estimated at 49 infant deaths per 1,000 births. The estimates of neonatal and postneonatal mortality are 23 and 26 per 1,000. <br>- Maternal and child health : Uzbekistan has a well-developed health system with an extensive infrastructure of facilities that provide maternal care services. This system includes special delivery hospitals, the obstetrics and gynecology departments of general hospitals, women's consulting centers, and doctor's assistant/midwife posts (FAPs). There is an extensive network of FAPs throughout rural areas. <br>- Nutrition : Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is almost universal in Uzbekistan; 96 percent of children born in the three years preceding the survey are breastfed. Overall, 19 percent of children are breastfed within an hour of delivery and 40 percent within 24 hours of delivery. The median duration of breastfeeding is lengthy (17 months). However, durations of exclusive breastfeeding, as recommended by WHO, are short (0.4 months). <br>- Prevalence of anemia : Testing of women and children for anemia was one of the major efforts of the 1996 UDHS. Anemia has been considered a major public health problem in Uzbekistan for decades. Nevertheless, this was the first anemia study in Uzbekistan done on a national basis. The study involved hemoglobin (Hb) testing for anemia using the Hemocue system. <br>Women. Sixty percent of the women in Uzbekistan suffer from some degree of anemia. The great majority of these women have either mild (45 percent) or moderate anemia (14 percent). One percent have severe anemia.",0050397,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Uganda - Demographic and Health Survey 1995,"The 1995 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS-II) is a nationally-representative survey of 7,070 women age 15-49 and 1,996 men age 15-54. The UDHS was designed to provide information on levels and trends of fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality, and maternal and child health. Fieldwork for the UDHS took place from late-March to mid-August 1995. The survey was similar in scope and design to the 1988-89 UDHS. Survey data show that fertility levels may be declining, contraceptive use is increasing, and childhood mortality is declining; however, data also point to several remaining areas of challenge.<br><br>The 1995 UDHS was a follow-up to a similar survey conducted in 1988-89. In addition to including most of the same questions included in the 1988-89 UDHS, the 1995 UDHS added more detailed questions on AIDS and maternal mortality, as well as incorporating a survey of men. The general objectives of the <br>1995 UDHS are to: <br>- provide national level data which will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly fertility and childhood mortality rates; <br>- analyse the direct and indirect factors which determine the level and trends of fertility; <br>- measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice (of both women and men) by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region; <br>- collect reliable data on maternal and child health indicators; immunisation, prevalence, and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under age four; antenatal visits; assistance at delivery; and breastfeeding; <br>- assess the nutritional status of children under age four and their mothers by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and also child feeding practices; and <br>- assess among women and men the prevailing level of specific knowledge and attitudes regarding AIDS and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Fertility:<br> <br>Fertility Trends. UDHS data indicate that fertility in Uganda may be starting to decline. The total fertility rate has declined from the level of 7.1 births per woman that prevailed over the last 2 decades to 6.9 births for the period 1992-94. The crude birth rate for the period 1992-94 was 48 live births per I000 population, slightly lower than the level of 52 observed from the 1991 Population and Housing Census. For the roughly 80 percent of the country that was covered in the 1988-89 UDHS, fertility has declined from 7.3 to 6.8 births per woman, a drop of 7 percent over a six and a half year period. <br><br>Birth Intervals. The majority of Ugandan children (72 percent) are born after a ""safe"" birth interval (24 or more months apart), with 30 percent born at least 36 months after a prior birth. Nevertheless, 28 percent of non-first births occur less than 24 months after the preceding birth, with 10 percent occurring less than 18 months since the previous birth. The overall median birth interval is 29 months. <br>Fertility Preferences. Survey data indicate that there is a strong desire for children and a preference for large families in Ugandan society. Among those with six or more children, 18 percent of married women want to have more children compared to 48 percent of married men. Both men and women desire large families. <br><br>- Family planning: <br><br>Knowledge of Contraceptive Methods. Knowledge of contraceptive methods is nearly universal with 92 percent of all women age 15-49 and 96 percent of all men age 15-54 knowing at least one method of family planning. Increasing Use of Contraception. The contraceptive prevalence rate in Uganda has tripled over a six-year period, rising from about 5 percent in approximately 80 percent of the country surveyed in 1988-89 to 15 percent in 1995. <br><br>Source of Contraception. Half of current users (47 percent) obtain their methods from public sources, while 42 percent use non-governmental medical sources, and other private sources account for the remaining 11 percent. <br><br>- Maternal and child health: <br><br>High Childhood Mortality. Although childhood mortality in Uganda is still quite high in absolute terms, there is evidence of a significant decline in recent years. Currently, the direct estimate of the infant mortality rate is 81 deaths per 1,000 births and under five mortality is 147 per 1,000 births, a considerable decline from the rates of 101 and 180, respectively, that were derived for the roughly 80 percent of the country that was covered by the 1988-89 UDHS. <br><br>Childhood Vaccination Coverage. One possible reason for the declining mortality is improvement in childhood vaccination coverage. The UDHS results show that 47 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated, and only 14 percent have not received any vaccinations. <br><br>Childhood Nutritional Status. Overall, 38 percent of Ugandan children under age four are classified as stunted (low height-for-age) and 15 percent as severely stunted. About 5 percent of children under four in Uganda are wasted (low weight-for-height); 1 percent are severely wasted. Comparison with other data sources shows little change in these measures over time. <br><br>- AIDS: <br><br>Virtually all women and men in Uganda are aware of AIDS. About 60 percent of respondents say that limiting the number of sexual partners or having only one partner can prevent the spread of disease. However, knowledge of ways to avoid AIDS is related to respondents' education. Safe patterns of sexual behaviour are less commonly reported by respondents who have little or no education than those with more education. Results show that 65 percent of women and 84 percent of men believe that they have little or no chance of being infected. <br><br>Availability of Health Services. Roughly half of women in Uganda live within 5 km of a facility  providing antenatal care, delivery care, and immunisation services. However, the data show that children  whose mothers receive both antenatal and delivery care are more likely to live within 5 km of a facility  providing maternal and child health (MCH) services (70 percent) than either those whose mothers received  only one of these services (46 percent) or those whose mothers received neither antenatal nor delivery care  (39 percent).",0050316,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Uganda - Investment Climate Survey 2003,"Uganda Investment Climate Survey was carried out between November 2002 and April 2003 by the World Bank's Regional Program on Enterprise Development (RPED) in collaboration with the Uganda Manufacturers Association Consultancy and Information Services (UMACIS). The survey covered 392 firms across four sectors (commercial agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and tourism) and three regions (central, northeast, and southwest). The dataset described in this study includes only manufacturing establishments (300 observations). <br><br>The questionnaire contained a range of questions on such issues as the production process, cost of inputs, access to finance, types and cost of labor used, and costs incurred in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS.<br><br>The Investment Climate Surveys (ICS) were conducted by the World Bank and its partners across all geographic regions and covered firms of all sizes in many industries. The ICS collected a wide array of qualitative and quantitative information through face-to-face interviews with managers and owners regarding the investment climate in their country and the productivity of their firms. Topics covered in the ICS included the obstacles to doing business, infrastructure, finance, labor, corruption and regulation, contract enforcement, law and order, innovation and technology, and firm productivity.

Uganda - Demographic and Health Survey 2006,"The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 8,531 women age 15-49 and 2,503 men age 15-54. The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. <br><br>The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  <br><br>The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: <br><br>- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates <br>- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality <br>- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region <br>- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use <br>- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices <br>- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding <br>- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children <br>- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates <br>- To collect information on the extent of disability <br>- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. <br><br>- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. <br><br>- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  <br><br>- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. <br><br>- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.<br><br>- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. <br><br>- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). <br><br>- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. <br><br>- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.<br><br>- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.",0050305,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Turkiye - Demographic and Health Survey 1993,"The 1993 Turkish Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) is a nationally representative survey of ever-married women less than 50 years old. The survey was designed to provide information on fertility levels and trends, infant and child mortality, family planning, and maternal and child health. The TDHS was conducted by the Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies under a subcontract through an agreement between the General Directorate of Mother and Child Health and Family Planning, Ministry of Health and Macro International Inc. of Calverton, Maryland. Fieldwork was conducted from August to October 1993. Interviews were carried out in 8,619 households and with 6,519 women.<br><br>The Turkish Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) is a national sample survey of ever-married women of reproductive ages, designed to collect data on fertility, marriage patterns, family planning, early age mortality, socioeconomic characteristics, breastfeeding, immunisation of children, treatment of children during episodes of illness, and nutritional status of women and children. The TDHS, as part of the international DHS project, is also the latest survey in a series of national-level population and health surveys in Turkey, which have been conducted by the Institute of Population Studies, Haeettepe University (HIPS). <br><br>More specifically, the objectives of the TDHS are to: <br><br>Collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly fertility and childhood mortality rates; Analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine levels and trends in fertility and childhood mortality; Measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice by method, region, and urban- rural residence; Collect data on mother and child health, including immunisations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections among children under five, antenatal care, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding; Measure the nutritional status of children under five and of their mothers using anthropometric measurements. <br><br>The TDHS information is intended to assist policy makers and administrators in evaluating existing programs and in designing new strategies for improving family planning and health services in Turkey. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Fertility in Turkey is continuing to decline. If Turkish women maintain current fertility rates during their reproductive years, they can expect to have all average of 2.7 children by the end of their reproductive years. The highest fertility rate is observed for the age group 20-24. There are marked regional differences in fertility rates, ranging from 4.4 children per woman in the East to 2.0 children per woman in the West. Fertility also varies widely by urban-rural residence and by education level. A woman living in rural areas will have almost one child more than a woman living in an urban area. Women who have no education have almost one child more than women who have a primary-level education and 2.5 children more than women with secondary-level education. <br><br>The first requirement of success ill family planning is the knowledge of family planning methods. Knowledge of any method is almost universal among Turkish women and almost all those who know a method also know the source of the method. Eighty percent of currently married women have used a method sometime in their life. One third of currently married women report ever using the IUD. Overall, 63 percent of currently married women are currently using a method. The majority of these women are modern method users (35 percent), but a very substantial proportion use traditional methods (28 percent). the IUD is the most commonly used modern method (I 9 percent), allowed by the condom (7 percent) and the pill (5 percent). Regional differences are substantial. The level of current use is 42 percent in tile East, 72 percent in tile West and more than 60 percent in tile other three regions. ""File common complaints about tile methods are side effects and health concerns; these are especially prevalent for the pill and IUD.<br><br>One of the major child health indicators is immunisation coverage. Among children age 12-23 months, the coverage rates for BCG and the first two doses of DPT and polio were about 90 percent, with most of the children receiving those vaccines before age one. The results indicate that 65 percent of the children had received all vaccinations at some time before the survey. On a regional basis, coverage is significantly lower in the Eastern region (41 percent), followed by the Northern and Central regions (61 percent and 65 percent, respectively). Acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea are the two most prevalent diseases of children under age five in Turkey. In the two weeks preceding the survey, the prevalence of ARI was 12 percent and the prevalence of diarrhea was 25 percent for children under age five. Among children with diarrhea 56 percent were given more fluids than usual. <br><br>Breastfeeding in Turkey is widespread. Almost all Turkish children (95 percent) are breastfed for some period of time. The median duration of breastfeeding is 12 months, but supplementary foods and liquids are introduced at an early age. One-third of children are being given supplementary food as early as one month of age and by the age of 2-3 months, half of the children are already being given supplementary foods or liquids. <br><br>By age five, almost one-filth of children arc stunted (short for their age), compared to an international reference population. Stunting is more prevalent in rural areas, in the East, among children of mothers with little or no education, among children who are of higher birth order, and among those born less than 24 months after a prior birth. Overall, wasting is not a problem. Two percent of children are wasted (thin for their height), and I I percent of children under five are underweight for their age. The survey results show that obesity is d problem among mothers. According to Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations, 51 percent of mothers are overweight, of which 19 percent are obese.",0050260,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Il est apparu cependant que le calendrier de la primo nuptialité des femmes devient de plus en plus tardif: avant 20 ans, 3 femmes sur quatre ne sont pas encore mariées et l'âge médian des femmes à la première union est de 18,4 ans. Une femme sur quatre (23,2 %) a contracté plus d'une union. <br><br>En ce qui concerne les déterminants proche de la fécondité, les femmes togolaises allaitent au sein en moyenne pendant 22,6 mois, ont une durée d'aménorrhée de 14,4 mois et une durée d'abstinence post-partum de 17,5 mois. <br><br>Le niveau de la fécondité est demeuré pratiquement stable dans le temps. L'indice synthétique de fécondité pour les femmes âgées de 15-49 ans est de 6,6 enfants alors que la descendance des femmes âgées de 45-49 ans est de 7,3 enfants. L'âge médian d'entrée en fécondité est de 19 ans environ. La tendance future de la fécondité semble être à la baisse du fait des jeunes générations qui entrent en union plus tard que leurs ainées avec également des taux de fécondité relativement plus faible. Néanmoins, cette tendance est relativisée par la faible prévalence de la contraception moderne: 3,4 pour cent. Il faut cependant garder å l'esprit que certaines méthodes dites naturelles, comme l'abstinence prolongée, est largement utilisée (21,8%), suivie de la continence périodique (6,4%). <br><br>L'EDST a également recueilli des données sur la mortalité infantile et juvénile ainsi que des informations relatives à la santé de la mère et de l'enfant. Le niveau de la mortalité infantile, entre la naissance et le premier anniversaire, est de 80 pour mille. Ce résultat a de quoi réjouir plus d'un responsable de la santé puisque deux décennies plus tôt, le taux de mortalité infantile était d'environ 130 pour mille. La situation de survie des enfants entre le premier et le cinquième anniversaire s'est également améliorée. <br><br>Les données collectées sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant ont montré que malgré une fréquentation importante des centres de soins, la prévalence de la diarrhée et des maladies respiratoires est relativement élevée. On a pu aussi se rendre compte que la plupart des femmes avaient été vaccinées contre le tétanos pour protéger ainsi leurs enfants contre cette maladie. <br><br>Enfin, des informations importantes ont été collectées sur le statut nutritionnel des enfants. Le problème majeur qui prévaut au Togo est, comme dans la plupart des pays africains, celui de la malnutrition chronique ou invisible. <br><br>Malgré la contribution des résultats obtenus, une meilleure compréhension des phénomènes observés nécessiterait des analyses plus approfondies des données.",0050214,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Timor-Leste - Living Standards Survey 2001,"Timor-Leste experienced a fundamental social and economic upheaval after its people voted for independence from Indonesia in a referendum in August 1999.  Population was displaced, and public and private infrastructure was destroyed or rendered inoperable. Soon after the violence ceased, the country began rebuilding itself with the support from UN agencies, the international donor community and NGOs. The government laid out a National Development Plan (NDP) with two central goals: to promote rapid, equitable and sustainable economic growth and to reduce poverty.  <br><br>Formulating a national plan and poverty reduction strategy required data on poverty and living standards, and given the profound changes experienced, new data collection had to be undertaken to accurately assess the living conditions in the country. The Planning Commission of the Timor-Leste Transitional Authority undertook a Poverty Assessment Project along with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  <br><br>This project comprised three data collection activities on different aspects  of living standards, which taken together, provide a  comprehensive picture of well-being in Timor-Leste. The first component was the Suco Survey, which is a census of all 498 sucos (villages) in the country. It provides an inventory of existing social and physical infrastructure and of the economic characteristics of each suco, in addition to aldeia (hamlet) level population figures. It was carried out between February and April 2001. <br><br>A second element was the Timor-Leste Living Standards Measurement Survey (TLSS). This is a household survey with a nationally representative sample of 1,800 families from 100 sucos. It was designed to diagnose the extent, nature and causes of poverty, and to analyze policy options facing the country. It assembles comprehensive information on household demographics, housing and assets, household expenditures and some components of income, agriculture, labor market data, basic health and education, subjective perceptions of poverty and social capital. <br><br>Data collection was undertaken between end August and November 2001.  <br><br>The final component was the Participatory Potential Assessment  (PPA), which is a qualitative community survey in 48 aldeias in the 13 districts of the country to take stock of their assets, skills and strengths, identify the main challenges and priorities, and formulate strategies for tackling these within their communities.

Timor-Leste - Survey of Living Standards 2007 and Extension 2008,"In 2007-2008 a multi-topic household survey, the Timor Leste Survey of Living Standards (TLSLS2) was conducted in East Timor with the main objectives of developing a system of poverty monitoring and supporting poverty reduction, and to monitor human development indicators and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Information collected in the TLSLS2 questionnaire included: household information, housing, access to facilities, expenditures/consumption, education, health, fertility and maternity history, employment, farming and livestock, transfers, borrowing and saving, other income, social capital, subjective well-being, AIDs and anthropometrics. <br><br>The TLSLS2-X extension survey was designed to re-visit one third of the households interviewed under the TLSLS2 2007-08 to explore different facets of household welfare and behavior in the country, while also being able to make use of information collected in the TLSLS2 survey for analytic purposes. <br><br>The four new topics investigated in the extension survey are: <br><br>- Risk and Vulnerability: This section is designed to help us understand the dimensions and sources of household-level vulnerability to uninsured risks in Timor Leste, and the efficacy and welfare effects of various risk-management strategies (prevention, mitigation, coping) and mechanisms (private as well as public, formal as well as informal) households do (or do not) have access to. The work in Timor Leste is part of a program of analytic work and policy dialogue throughout the EAP region, more information on which can be found on the World Bank website. <br><br>- Land Degradation and Poverty: This section of the questionnaire is designed to identify proximate causes of deforestation through land use patterns and links with poverty; understand strengths and failures of common land resource management institutions (property rights, enforcement); understand the impact of the Siam Weed problem on household welfare. <br><br>- Justice for Poor: The Justice for the Poor/Access to Justice (J4P/A2J) module of the survey will serve mainly as an initial diagnostic for project development in the country. The topics we would be interested in covering would be Dispute Processing/Resolution; Social Legal Norms and Perceptions of Efficiency in Government (Local, Sub-District, District and National level). <br><br>- Access to Financial Services: The financial service work has the following two objectives: (i) to collect data on access to and use financial services (savings and credit), both formal and informal, and (ii) assess the quality of information on access to financial services obtained from head of households vs. from all adults - i.e. is there a bias introduced by not asking all household members, do the characteristics of the head or the household affect this (gender, age, nuclear family, urban, education levels, wealth, etc.).",0050196,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Tanzania - Kagera Health and Development Survey 1991-1994 (Wave 1 to 4 Panel),"The Kagera Health and Development Survey was conducted for the research project on “The Economic Impact of Fatal Adult Illness due to AIDS and Other Causes”, Mead Over (Principal Investigator, World Bank), Martha Ainsworth (Co-investigator, World Bank), and Godlike Koda, George Lwihula, Phare Mujinja, and Innocent Semali (Co-investigators, University of Dar es Salaam).<br><br>The primary objective of the Kagera Health and Development Survey (KHDS) was to estimate the economic impact of the death of prime-age adults on surviving household members. This impact was primarily measured as the difference in well-being between households with and without the death of a prime-age adult (15-50), over time. An additional hypothesis was that households in communities with high mortality rates might be less successful in coping with a prime-age adult death. Thus, the research design called for collecting extensive socioeconomic information from households with and without adult deaths in communities with high and low adult mortality rates. Data collected by the KHDS can be used to estimate the ""direct costs” of illness and mortality in terms of out-of-pocket expenditures, the ""indirect costs"" in terms of foregone earnings of the patient, and the ""coping costs” in terms of changes in the well-being of other household members and in the allocation on of time and resources within the household as these events unfold.<br><br>The KHDS was an economic survey. It did not attempt to measure knowledge, attitudes, behaviors or practices related to HIV infection or AIDS in households or communities. It also did not collect blood samples or attempt to measure HIV seroprevalence; this would have substantially affected the costs and complexity of the research and possibly the willingness of households to participate. Information on the cause of death in the KHDS household survey is based on the reports of surviving household members; the researchers maintained that household coping will respond to the perceived cause of death, irrespective of whether the deceased actually died of AIDS. Lastly, the KHDS did not attempt to measure the psycho-social impact of HIV infection or AIDS deaths.<br><br>OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH DESIGN<br><br>The research design called for a longitudinal survey of a sample of households, some of which would experience an adult death and some of which would not, some of them drawn from communities with high adult mortality rates, and some drawn from low-mortality communities. <br><br>The sampling frame for the survey was based on the 1988 Tanzania Census, which also provided information on adult death rates by ward within Kagera region. While it was possible to determine which communities had relatively high and low adult death rates from the census data, two additional problems arose that led to the decision for a stratified sample of households based on multiple criteria:<br><br>- First, despite the high rates of HIV infection in Kagera and the large number of deaths over time due to AIDS, the death of a prime-age adult is still a relatively rare event over a short time period. This meant that a very large sample would have had to be selected in order to ensure that the survey could interview enough families suffering our about to suffer the death of a prime-age adult.<br><br>- Second, HIV prevalence and adult mortality rates in Kagera were geographically concentrated and thus strongly correlated with different climates and cropping patterns. The highest rural HIV infection rates were in the northeast (10% in Bukoba Rural and Muleba districts and 24% in the town of Bukoba), where tree crops (bananas, coffee) were predominant, while the lowest rates were in the south and west (0.4% in Ngara and Biharamulo districts), where perennial crops and livestock are more common (Killewo and others 1990). A survey design stratified only on mortality rates might confound the effects of high mortality with different agricultural, soil, and rainfall patterns. Thus, the sample of households was selected from a stratified random sample of communities from the 1988 census (stratified on agroclimatic zone and adult mortality rate). Within communities, the household sample was stratified according to the anticipated risk of each household of suffering a prime-age adult death. Households were classified as “high-risk” or “low-risk”, based on information obtained from a house-to-house enumeration of all selected communities.<br><br>One additional concern was that the high mortality of households might lead to attrition from the sample that is systematically related to household coping. For example, if out-migration is an important coping behavior, then the most severely affected households might leave the sample and the analysis of the remaining households would understate the economic impact of adult deaths. For this reason, at the conclusion of the fieldwork, interviewers attempted to locate and interview all of the individuals who were members of households that dropped out of the longitudinal survey between the first and last interviews, and who were still resident in the region. Individuals were given a specially designed “follow-up questionnaire” that included much of the individual information collected in the household questionnaire, plus information on the reason for leaving the sample and the characteristics of the household were they were now<br>residing.<br><br>The final longitudinal household survey followed 816 households at 6-7 month intervals, over a 24-month period from 1991-94. The 816 households were selected from 51 “clusters” of 16 households each located in 49 villages or urban areas representing four economic zones of all districts in Kagera region and, within each zone, representing areas with both high and low adult mortality.<br><br>Because household coping behavior is conditioned on local prices, services, and available programs, the KHDS also collected data from the communities from which households were drawn, local markets, the nearest source of modern medical care, and all of the primary schools in the community. This information was collected longitudinally, with the exception of a questionnaire for traditional healers, which was administered only once. While households were drawn from a stratified random sample of households, the health facilities, schools, markets and healers interviewed represent those closest to each community and thus are not random samples that are statistically representative of Kagera facilities.<br><br>The panel survey was conducted in a total of five waves.<br><br>- Wave 1 September 1991 - May 1992<br>- Wave 2 April 1992 - November 1992<br>- Wave 3 November 1992 - May 1993<br>- Wave 4 June 1993 - January 1994<br>- Wave 5 - 2004",0050173,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Tanzania - Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire 2003,"The Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) currently constitutes one of the largest socio-economic household survey databases on Tanzania. Since 2003 EDI has interviewed roughly 20,000 households in 35 different districts. For 9 districts repeat surveys have been organised to track changes over time.<br><br>Rationale: Absence of district level survey data does not rhyme with the devolution of power to districts. Tanzania is undergoing a decentralisation process whereby each of its roughly 128 districts is becoming an increasingly important policy actor.

The MICS was designed to collect information on a variety of socioeconomic and health indicators required to inform the planning, implementation and monitoring of national policies and programs for the enhancement of the welfare of women and children.<br><br>The survey was carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in collaboration with the ministries of health, welfare, general education, national environment, and national water cooperation as part of the global MICS program. Technical support was provided by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). UNICEF, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Food Program (WFP) and the Department for International Development (DfID) UK, provided financial support. <br><br>MICS surveys measure key indicators that allow countries to generate accurate evidence for use in policies and programs, and to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed upon commitments. The Sudan Multiple Indicator Survey is a nationally representative sample survey. Interviews were successfully completed in 15,801 households drawn from a sample of 18,000 households in all 18 states of Sudan with an overall response rate of 98 percent. 20,327 women in the 15-49 years age group, and 14,751 children under 5 years of age. The specific objectives of the survey is to: <br><br>1. Update information for assessing the situation of children and women in Sudan based on MICS5 modules and geographical coverage of the 18 States in Sudan. <br>2. Measure the trend towards achievement of the MDGs and the goals of a World Fit For Children Plan of Action and other internationally agreed upon indicators related to children and women. <br>3. Furnish data needed for the indicators as per the global review of the Millennium Development Goals. <br>4. Contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Sudan and to strengthen technical expertise, national capacity building in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems. <br>5. Update Census indicators and provide solid evidence for decentralization (planning and measure of progress). <br>6. Provide key evidence for social sector programming and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) under development and accountabilities for sector strategic plans and UNDAF 2013-2016. <br><br>Results presented in this survey have been reviewed by the national MICS Technical Committee and approved by the national MICS Steering Committee.

Sri Lanka - Demographic and Health Survey 1987,"The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is an important link in a chain of surveys carried out in Sri Lanka in the past decade or so. Having been designed as part of an international survey program and modelled on the lines of the well renowned World Fertility Survey (WFS) program, the DHS provides an exceptionally valuable source of data for the estimation of trends over time within Sri Lanka as well as for cross national comparison. <br><br>The survey focussed primarily on fertility, contraception and child mortality as did WFS but. also measured several indicators of child health, particularly immunization coverage and nutrition status. The inclusion of health sector information has been welcome and fruitful, for improve- ment of nutrition status is a subject to which the Government of Sri Lanka has accorded high priority. <br><br>The Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey has the following objectives: <br>1. To provide policymakers and administrators with current and accurate data on fertility, morbidity, family planning and selected indicators of health status which could be used for planning new strategies for the wellbeing of the population; etc. <br>2. To provide data which can be used to analyze trends over time. The SLDHS examines many of the same fertility, mortality, and health issues that were addressed in earlier surveys, most notably the SLWFS and the more recent SLCPS; and <br>3.

Sri Lanka - Microenterprise Survey 2005-2010,"Researchers from the World Bank, Sri Lanka's University of Peradeniya and United Kingdom's University of Warwick designed an experiment to measure the impact of providing capital grants to microenterprises. One-time grants of between US $100 and $200 were given to male and female-owned enterprises, some of whom had been affected by the December 2004 tsunami.<br><br>The baseline survey was conducted in April 2005. A door-to-door screening survey of households was used to identify enterprises with invested capital of 100,000 rupees (about US$1000) or less, excluding investments in land and buildings. The final sample included 617 enterprises in retail trade and manufacturing, operated by owners 22 to 65 years old, and with no paid employees. The firms were engaged in common self-employment activities such as running small grocery stores, selling tea, food preparation (e.g. string hoppers), sewing clothes, making lace products, and coir production.<br><br>Researchers then re-interviewed the owners of baseline firms at quarterly intervals, from July 2005 to April 2007, and semi-annually - in October 2007 and April 2008.

Sri Lanka - Demographic and Health Survey 2006-2007,"The 2006-07 Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) is the fourth in a series of DHS surveys to be held in Sri Lanka-the first three having been implemented in 1987, 1993, and 2000. Teams visited 2,106 sample points across Sri Lanka and collected data from a na­tionally representative sample of almost 20,000 households and over 14,700 women age 15-49. <br><br>A nationally representative sample of 21,600 housing units was selected for the survey and 19,872 households were enumerated to give district level estimates (excluding Northern Province). Detailed information was collected from all ever-married women aged 15-49 years and about their children below five years at the time of the survey. Within the households interviewed, a total of 15,068 eligible women were identified, of whom 14,692 were successfully interviewed.  <br><br>The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) carried out the 2006-07 SLDHS for the Health Sector Development Project (HSDP) of the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, a pro­ject funded by the World Bank. The objective of the survey is to provide data needed to monitor and evaluate the impact of population, health, and nutrition programmes implemented by dif­ferent government agencies.  Additionally, it also aims to measure the impact of interventions made under the HSDP towards improving the quality and efficiency of health care services as a whole. <br><br>All 25 districts of Sri Lanka were included at the design stage. The final sample has only 20 districts, however, after dropping the 5 districts of the Northern Province (Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya, and Mullativu), due to the security situation there. <br><br>OBJECTIVES<br><br>The objective of this report is to publish the final findings of the 2006-07 SLDHS. This final report provides information mainly on background characteristics of respondents, fertility, reproductive health and maternal care, child health, nutrition, women's empowerment, and awareness of HIV/AIDS and prevention. It is expected that the content of this report will satisfy the urgent needs of users of this information. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY <br>Survey results indicate that there has been a slight upturn in the total fertility rate since the 2000 SLDHS. The total fertility rate for Sri Lanka is 2.3, meaning that, if current age-specific fertility rates were to remain unchanged in the future, a woman in Sri Lanka would have an average of 2.3 children by the end of her childbearing period. This is somewhat higher than the total fertility rate of 1.9 measured in the 2000 SLDHS.  <br><br>Fertility is only slightly lower in urban areas than in rural areas (2.2 and 2.3 children per woman, respectively); however, it is higher in the estate areas (2.5 children per woman). Interpreta­tion of variations in fertility by administrative districts is limited by the small samples in some districts. Nevertheless, results indicate that Galle and Puttalam districts have fertility rates of 2.1 or below, which is at what is known as “replace­ment level” fertility, i.e., the level that is neces­sary to maintain population size over time. Dif­ferences in fertility by level of women's educa­tion and a measure of relative wealth status are minimal.  <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br>According to the survey findings, knowledge of any method of family planning is almost uni­versal in Sri Lanka and there are almost no dif­ferences between ever-married and currently married women. Over 90 percent of currently married women have heard about pills, in­jectables, female sterilization, and the IUD. Eight out of ten respondents know about some tradi­tional method of delaying or avoiding pregnan­cies. <br><br>Although the proportion of currently married women who have heard of at least one method of family planning has been high for some time, knowledge of some specific methods has in­creased recently. Since 1993, knowledge of im­plants has increased five-fold-from about 10 percent in 1993 to over 50 percent in 2006-07. Awareness about pill, IUD, injectables, implants, and withdrawal has also increased. On the other hand, awareness of male sterilization has dropped by 14 percentage points.  <br><br>CHILD HEALTH <br>The study of infant and child mortality is critical for assessment of population and health policies and programmes. Infant and child mor­tality rates are also regarded as indices reflecting the degree of poverty and deprivation of a popu­lation. Survey data show that for the most recent five-year period before the survey, the infant mortality rate is 15 deaths per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality is 21 deaths per 1,000 live births. Thus, one in every 48 Sri Lankan children dies before reaching age five. The neo­natal mortality rate is 11 deaths per 1,000 live births and the postneonatal mortality rate is 5 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate is 5 deaths per 1,000 children surviving to age one year.  <br><br>REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH <br>The survey shows that virtually all mothers (99 percent) in Sri Lanka receive antenatal care from a health professional (doctor specialist, doc­tor, or midwife). The proportion receiving care from a skilled provider is remarkably uniform across all categories for age, residence, district, woman's education, and household wealth quin­tile. Even in the estate sector, antenatal care us­age is at the same high level. Although doctors are the most frequently seen provider (96 per­cent), women also go to public health midwives often for prenatal care (44 percent). <br><br>BREASTFEEDING AND NUTRITION <br>Poor nutritional status is one of the most im­portant health and welfare problems facing Sri Lanka today and particularly affects women and children. The survey data show that 17 percent of children under five are stunted or short for their age, while 15 percent of children under five are wasted or too thin for their height. Overall, 21 percent of children are underweight, which may reflect stunting, wasting, or both. As for women, at the national level, 16 percent of women are considered to be thin (with a body mass index < 18.5); however, only 6 percent of women are considered to be moderately or severely thin.  <br><br>Poor breastfeeding and infant feeding prac­tices can have adverse consequences for the health and nutritional status of children. Fortu­nately, breastfeeding in Sri Lanka is universal and generally of fairly long duration; 97 percent of newborns are breastfed within one day after delivery and 76 percent of infants under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, lower than the recommended 100 percent exclusive breastfeed­ing for children under 6 months. The median du­ration of any breastfeeding is 33 months in Sri Lanka and the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding is 5 months. <br><br>HIV/AIDS <br>The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious health concern in the world today because of its high case fatality rate and the lack of a cure. Aware­ness of AIDS is almost universal among Sri Lankan adults, with 92 percent of ever-married women saying that they have heard about AIDS. Nevertheless, only 22 percent of ever-married women are classified as having “comprehensive knowledge” about AIDS, i.e., knowing that con­sistent use of condoms and having just one faith­ful partner can reduce the chance of getting in­fected, knowing that a healthy-looking person can be infected, and knowing that AIDS cannot be transmitted by sharing food or by mosquito bites. Such a low level of knowledge about AIDS implies that a concerted effort is needed to ad­dress misconceptions about HIV transmission. Programs might be focused in the estate sector and especially in Batticaloa, Ampara, and Nu­wara Eliya districts where comprehensive knowl­edge is lowest. <br><br>Moreover, a composite indicator on stigma towards HIV-infected people shows that only 8 percent of ever-married women expressed ac­cepting attitudes toward persons living with HIV/AIDS. Overall, only about one- half of ever-married women age 15-49 years know where to get an HIV test. <br><br>WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH OUTCOMES <br>The 2006-07 SLDHS collected data on women's empowerment, their participation in decisionmaking, and attitudes towards wife beat­ing. Survey results show that more than 90 per­cent of currently married women, either alone or jointly with their husband, make decisions on how their income is used. However, husbands' control over women's earnings is higher among women with no education (15 percent) than among women with higher education (4 percent). <br><br>In Sri Lanka, the husband is usually the main source of household income; two-thirds of women earn less than their husband. Although the majority of women earn less than their hus­band, almost half have autonomy in decisions about how to spend their earnings. <br><br>The survey also collected information on who decides how the husband's cash earnings are spent. The majority of couples (60 percent) make joint decisions on how the husband's cash in­come is used. More than 1 in 5 women (23 per­cent) reported that they decide how their hus­band's earnings are used; another 16 percent of the women reported that their husband mainly decides how his earnings are spent.",0050034,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

South Africa - General Household Survey 2003,"Stats SA conducted the October Household Survey (OHS) annually from 1994 to 1999, based on a probability sample of a large number of households ranging from 16 000 to 30 000 households each year (depending on availability of funding). This survey was discontinued in 1999 due to the reprioritisation of surveys in the face of financial constraints. February 2000 saw the birth of the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is a biannual survey conducted by Stats SA in March and September of each year. The LFS covers some areas previously covered by the OHS, but not all, since it is a specialised survey principally designed to measure the dynamics in the labour market. The September LFS each year does include a section designed to measure social indicators such as access to infrastructure, but again this section does not go into as much depth as the OHS used to. A need was therefore identified by our users for a regular survey designed specifically to measure the level of development and the performance of government programmes and projects. The General Household Survey (GHS) was developed for this purpose. While the survey replaces the October Household Survey (OHS), the indicators measured in the 13 nodal areas identified for the Integrated Rural Development Strategy (IRSD) formed the basis for the subject matter of the survey. The first round of the GHS was conducted in July 2002 and the second round in July 2003.",0049904,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

South Africa - Department of Social Development Survey 2006-2008,"The Department of Social Development (DSD) commissioned a set of socio-economic and demographic baseline studies in the 22 nodes  that make up the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme (ISRDP) and Urban Renewal Programme (URP), coupled to a management support programme, that ran from 2006 to 2008. The nodes – 14 of which fall under the ISRDP and 8 of which fall under the URP – were selected because of the deep poverty in which many of their citizens live. The ISRDP and URP aimed to transform their respective nodes into economically vibrant and socially cohesive areas initially through anchor projects to kick-start the programmes, and then through better co-ordination between departments geared to providing an integrated suite of services to all citizens, especially those living in poverty. The point of both programmes is the more efficient and effective use of existing government resources, rather than operating as standard, stand-alone programmes with a dedicated budget. Two surveys were commissioned: a larger baseline in 2006 and a smaller measurement survey in 2008. In the interim, the Department implemented a national, provincial and nodal support programme while considering and reacting to the findings of the first phase of background reports and qualitative nodal-level evaluations.

Sierra Leone - Demographic and Health Survey 2008,"The 2008 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) is the first DHS survey to be held in Sierra Leone. Teams visited 353 sample points across Sierra Leone and collected data from a nationally representative sample of 7,374 women age 15-49 and 3,280 men age 15­-59. The primary purpose of the 2008 SLDHS is to provide policy-makers and planners with de­tailed information  on Demography and health.<br><br>This is the first Demographic and Health Survey conducted in Sierra Leone and was carried out by Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. The 2008 SLDHS was funded by the Sierra Leone government, UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF, DFID, USAID, and The World Bank. WHO, WFP and UNHCR provided logistical support. ICF Macro, an ICF International Company, provided technical support for the survey through the MEASURE DHS project. MEASURE DHS is sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to assist countries worldwide in obtaining information on key population and health indicators. <br><br>The purpose of the SLDHS is to collect national- and regional-level data on fertility and contraceptive use, marriage and sexual activity, fertility preferences, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women and young children, childhood and adult mortality, maternal and child health, female genital cutting, awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, adult health, and other issues. The survey obtained detailed information on these topics from women of reproductive age and, for certain topics, from men as well. The 2008 SLDHS was carried out from late April 2008 to late June 2008, using a nationally representative sample of 7,758 households. <br><br>The survey results are intended to assist policymakers and planners in assessing the current health and population programmes and in designing new strategies for improving reproductive health and health services in Sierra Leone. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Survey results indicate that there has been little or no decline in the total fertility rate over the past two decades, from 5.7 children per woman in 1980-85 to 5.1 children per woman for the three years preceding the 2008 SLDHS (approximately 2004-07). Fertility is lower in urban areas than in rural areas (3.8 and 5.8 chil­dren per woman, respectively). Regional varia­tions in fertility are marked, ranging from 3.4 births per woman in the Western Region (where the capital, Freetown, is located) to almost six births per woman in the Northern and Eastern regions. Women with no education give birth to almost twice as many children as women who have been to secondary school (5.8 births, com­pared with 3.1 births). Fertility is also closely associated with household wealth, ranging from 3.2 births among women in the highest wealth quintile to 6.3 births among women in the lowest wealth quintile, a difference of more than three births. Research has demonstrated that children born too close to a previous birth are at increased risk of dying. In Sierra Leone, only 18 percent of births occur within 24 months of a previous birth. The interval between births is relatively long; the median interval is 36 months. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>The vast majority of Sierra Leonean women and men know of at least one method of contra­ception. Contraceptive pills and injectables are known to about 60 percent of currently married women and 49 percent of married men. Male condoms are known to 58 percent of married women and 80 percent of men. A higher propor­tion of respondents reported knowing a modern method of family planning than a traditional method. <br><br>About one in five (21 percent) currently married women has used a contraceptive method at some time-19 percent have used a modern method and 6 percent have used a traditional method. However, only about one in twelve cur­rently married women (8 percent) is currently using a contraceptive method. Modern methods account for almost all contraceptive use, with 7 percent of married women reporting use of a modern method, compared with only 1 percent using a traditional method. Injectables and the pill are the most widely used methods (3 and 2 percent of married women, respectively), fol­lowed by LAM and male condoms (less than 1 percent each). <br> <br>CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Examination of levels of infant and child mortality is essential for assessing population and health policies and programmes. Infant and child mortality rates are also used as indices re­flecting levels of poverty and deprivation in a population. The 2008 survey data show that over the past 15 years, infant and under-five mortality have decreased by 26 percent. Still, one in seven Sierra Leonean children dies before reaching age five. For the most recent five-year period before the survey (approximately calendar years 2003 to 2008), the infant mortality rate was 89 deaths per 1,000 live births and the under-five mortality rate was 140 deaths per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate was 36 deaths per 1,000 live births and the post-neonatal mortality rate was 53 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate was 56 deaths per 1,000 children surviving to age one year. <br>Mortality rates at all ages of childhood show a strong relationship with the length of the pre­ceding birth interval. Under-five mortality is three times higher among children born less than two years after a preceding sibling (252 deaths per 1,000 births) than among children born four or more years after a previous child (deaths 81 per 1,000 births). <br><br>MATERNAL HEALTH <br><br>Almost nine in ten mothers (87 percent) in Sierra Leone receive antenatal care from a health professional (doctor, nurse, midwife, or MCH aid). Only 5 percent of mothers receive antenatal care from a traditional midwife or a community health worker; 7 percent of mothers do not re­ceive any antenatal care. <br><br>In Sierra Leone, over half of mothers have four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits, about 20 percent have one to three ANC visits, and only 7 percent have no antenatal care at all. The survey shows that not all women in Sierra Leone receive antenatal care services early in preg­nancy. Only 30 percent of mothers obtain ante­natal care in the first three months of pregnancy, 41 percent make their first visit in the fourth or fifth month, and 17 percent in have their first visit in the sixth or seventh month. Only 1 per­cent of women have their first ANC visit in their eighth month of pregnancy or later. <br><br>BREASTFEEDING AND NUTRITION <br><br>Poor nutritional status is one of the most im­portant health and welfare problems facing Si­erra Leone today and particularly afflicts women and children. The data show that 36 percent of children under five are stunted (too short for their age) and 10 percent of children under five are wasted (too thin for their height). Overall, 21 percent of children are underweight, which may reflect stunting, wasting, or both. For women, at the national level 11 percent of women are con­sidered to be thin (body mass index <18.5); however, only 4 percent of women are consid­ered severely thin. At the other end of a spec­trum, 20 percent of women age 15-49 are con­sidered to be overweight (body mass index 25.0­25.9) and 9 percent are considered obese (body mass index =30.0). <br><br>HIV/AIDS <br><br>The HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the most serious health concerns in the world today be­cause of its high case-fatality rate and the lack of a cure. Awareness of AIDS is relatively high among Sierra Leonean adults age 15-49, with 69 percent of women and 83 percent of men saying that they have heard about AIDS. Nevertheless, only 14 percent of women and 25 percent of men are classified as having 'comprehensive knowl­edge' about AIDS, i.e., knowing that consistent use of condoms during sexual intercourse and having just one faithful, HIV-negative partner can reduce the chances of getting HIV/AIDS, knowing that a healthy-looking person can have HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and knowing that HIV cannot be transmitted by sharing food/utensils with someone who has HIV/AIDS, or by mosquito bites. <br><br>Such a low level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS implies that a concerted effort is needed to address misconceptions about the transmission of HIV in Sierra Leone. Compre­hensive knowledge is substantially lower among respondents with no education and those who live in the poorest households. Programmes could be targeted to populations in rural areas, and especially women in the Northern and Southern regions and men in the Eastern Region, where comprehensive knowledge is lowest. A composite indicator on stigma towards people who are HIV positive shows that only 5 percent of women and 15 percent of men age 15-49 ex­pressed accepting attitudes towards persons liv­ing with HIV/AIDS. <br> <br>FEMALE CIRCUMCISION <br><br>The 2008 SLDHS collected data on the prac­tice of female circumcision (or female genital cutting) in Sierra Leone. Awareness of the prac­tice is universally high. Almost all (99 percent) of Sierra Leonean women and 96 percent of men age 15-49 have heard of the practice. The preva­lence of female circumcision is high (91 per­cent). Most women (82 percent) reported that the cutting involves the removal of flesh. The most radical procedure, infibulation-when vagina is sewn closed during the circumcision-is re­ported by only 3 percent of women. The survey results indicate that almost all of the women were circumcised by traditional practitioners (95 percent); only a small proportion of circumci­sions were performed by a trained health profes­sional (0.3 percent). <br><br>Among Sierra Leonean adults age 15-49 who have heard of female circumcision, more men than women oppose the practice (41 and 26 percent, respectively), which is similar to pat­terns in other West African countries.",0049705,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Senegal - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1986,"L'EDS Sénégal s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un vaste projet international de recherches sur la fécondité, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant et la planification familiale intitulé ""Enquête Démographique et de Santé"" (Demographic and Health Surveys). Le projet est financé par I'USAID et exécuté par l'Institute for Resource Development (IRD) de Westingbouse. L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé du Sénégal (EDS) était réalisée au milieu de l'année 1986 par la Division des Enquêtes et de la Démographie de la Direction de la Statistique (Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances) avec l'assistance technique et financière de I'IRD. <br><br>Les objectifs assignés à I'EDS sont: <br>- Recueillir des données sur les niveaux de la fécondité et de l'utilisation de la contraception et sur les facteurs qui influent sur ces niveaux; <br>- Recueillir des données sur certains aspects de la santé de la mère et de l'enfant (soins pré et postnatals, incidence et traitement de certaines maladies de l'enfance, vaccination, mesures anthropométriques); <br>- Aider les pays à l'institutionnalisation d'enquêtes périodiques qui permettent d'évaluer plus efficacement les programmes publics en matière de population, de santé et de planification familiale. <br><br>Les objectifs particuliers sont:<br>- Fournir des données de base sur la santé, la mortalité et la fécondité; <br>- Fournir des données de base sur la connaissance et la pratique de la planification familiale. <br><br>La réalisation de ces deux objectifs permettra de faire un bilan diagnostic à la veille du lancement du projet conjoint ""Santé Familiale et Population"" initié par les Ministères du Développement Social et de la Santé Publique. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>Le mariage demeure universel et est caractérisé par sa précocité où plus de 50 pour cent des femmes sont mariées avant 17 ans. Les femmes passent donc l'essentiel de leur vie féconde en union, exposées au risque des relations sexuelles. Celles-ci sont reprises assez tôt après l'accouchement avec une durée médiane de 2,7 mois seulement. L'allaitement par contre, est quasi général et demeure très prolongé; les mères allaitent en moyenne 19 mois. Ce qui contribue sure- ment à l'allongement de l'aménorrhée post-partum qui est l'une des plus longues en Afrique (durée moyenne de 16,2 mois). <br><br>La fécondité est également très précoce et reste à un niveau élevé. En effet, malgré une baisse récente de la fécondité, imputable aux générations de moins de 30 ans, la somme des naissances réduites se situe encore à 6,6 enfants chez les femmes de 15-49 ans. Elle était de 7,1 selon I'ESF de 1978. Pour ce qui est de la parité moyenne totale, elle est restée inchangée chez les femmes en union (4 enfants). <br><br>L'enquête a montré que les femmes sénégalaises sont très attachées à 1 a famille nombreuse, bien qu'il ait des changements dans la dimension idéale de la famille entre 1978 (9,0 enfants) et 1986 (7,2 enfants). On assiste aussi à des changements visa-a-vis de la planification familiale. La connaissance des méthodes contraceptives est presque quasi totale (9 femmes sur 10 connaissent au moins un moyen anticonceptionnel). En 1978, la connaissance était 60 pour cent. La prévalence contraceptive est passée de 4 pour cent en 1978 a 11 pour cent en 1986, mais la contraception moderne est restée extrêmement faible (2,4 pour cent) bien qu'elle ait connu une augmentation très importante par rapport a 1978, qui était de 0,6 pour cent seulement. <br><br>L'EDS a, par ailleurs recueilli des données sur la mortalité infantile et juvénile et sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant. Le niveau de mortalité infantile et juvénile demeure élevé, l'un des plus forts en Afrique malgré une baisse non négligeable depuis 1978. En effet, le quotient de mortalité infantile lq0 est estimé par cette enquête 86 pour mille durant la période de 1981-85. La mortalité des enfants de 1 à 4 ans pour la période la plus récente est de l'ordre de 11,4 pour mille. Il s'agit d'une sur- mortalité juvénile, qui a été observée dans d'autres études et qui s'explique probablement par les conditions sociales et l'environnement. Concernant la santé de la mère et de l'enfant, l'enquête a montré que plus de 6 femmes sur 10 ont bénéficié d'une visite prénatale à un service de santé pour les naissances des cinq dernières années et que l'accouchement a domicile reste pratiqué par la majorité des femmes sénégalaises (58 pour cent). <br><br>L'incidence et le traitement de la diarrhée et du paludisme sont également présentés dans ce rapport. Presque 40 pour cent des enfants de moins de 5 ans ont eu la diarrhée au cours des deux dernières semaines. La réhydratation par voie orale comme traitement contre cette maladie est citée par très peu de mères (7 pour cent). L'étude du paludisme pendant l'hivernage dernier indique que la moitié des enfants de moins de cinq ans ont eu la maladie selon les déclarations des mères et que ces dernières prennent au sérieux le paludisme puisque la quasi-totalité des enfants (93 pour cent) ont reçu un traitement contre la maladie. <br><br>L'enquête a donné des informations sur la disponibilité des carnets de santé et la couverture vaccinale a partir de ces documents de soins. Moins du quart (24 pour cent) des enfants de moins de cinq ans ont des carnets de santé que l'enquêtrice a vus et que parmi les enfants de 1 a 4 ans ayant des carnets, 30 pour cent sont vaccin6s contre toutes les maladies: BCG, DTCoq, Polio et Rougeole. <br><br>Enfin, I'EDS a collecté des données sur les mesures anthropométriques (poids et mille) des enfants de 6/136 mois d'un sous échantillon des femmes enquêtées. Les indices étudiés sont: le poids-pour-taille, la taille-pour-âge et le poids-pour-âge. Si la dénutrition de modérée à sévère est relativement faible au Sénégal, la dénutrition chronique par contre, est élevée étant donné que le quart des enfants souffrent d'une déficience alimentaire chronique sévère ou modérée. <br><br>L'éducation et l'urbanisation semblent être les deux variables qui sont les plus corrélés aux indicateurs qu'on vient de présenter. Mais ces deux variables agissent en étroite relation avec le degré de développement socio-économique.",0049664,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Senegal - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1992-1993,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDS-II) de 1992/93, a été réalisée par la Division des Statistiques Démographiques de la Direction de la Prévision et de la Statistique du Ministère de l'Economie des Finances et du Plan, avec la collaboration de Macro International Inc, et l'appui financier de l'Agence Américaine pour le Développement International (USAID). <br><br>Cette enquête vient à la suite de l'Enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDS-I) de 1986 qui avait pour but de fournir des informations sur la fécondité et ses déterminants, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant et la mortalité des enfants. L'EDS-II se propose de mettre à jour ces données et permettre ainsi d'apprécier les tendances de certains indicateurs démographiques. Mais en plus des informations qui ont été collectées en 1986, I'EDS-II fournit, pour la première fois au niveau national, des données sur la nutrition des mères, sur la mortalité maternelle et sur les hommes. L'EDS-II a permis en outre d'approfondir certains sujets encore peu connus. Il s'agit notamment, de l'état de santé des enfants, la prévention des maladies infantiles et la connaissance et les attitudes vis-à-vis des maladies sexuellement transmissibles y compris le SIDA. <br><br>L'EDS-II est une enquête nationale représentative par sondage. Elle a porté sur un échantillon autopondér6 de 3528 ménages dans lesquels 6310 femmes de 15 à 49 ans et 1436 hommes de 20 ans et plus ont été interviewés avec succès. Les principales caractéristiques des échantillons (structures par sexe, par âge, instruction, ethnie et résidence...) sont en parfaite concordance avec les résultats de 1'EDS-I et du recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 1988.<br><br>La deuxième Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Sénégal de 1992-93 (EDS-II) a été réalisée par la Direction de la Prévision et de la Statistique, avec la collaboration technique de Macro lnternational (USA) et l'appui financier de l'Agence Américaine pour le Développement International (USAID). Cette enquête, qui entre dans le cadre du programme des Enquêtes Démographiques et de Santé-EDS (ou Demographic and Health Surveys-DHS), vise à atteindre un certain nombre d'objectifs à court et à long termes: <br><br>- Recueillir des données à l'échelle nationale, par milieu de résidence et par région, permettant de calculer certains taux démographiques, en particulier les taux de fécondité et les taux de mortalité maternelle et infanto-juvénile; <br>- Analyser les facteurs qui déterminent les niveaux et les tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité infantile et juvénile; <br>- Mesurer le taux d'utilisation de la contraception par méthode selon le milieu de résidence et certaines caractéristiques socio-économiques; <br>- Mesurer les niveaux des besoins non satisfaits en matière de contraception ainsi que les niveaux de la fécondité non désirée; <br>- Recueillir des données précises sur la santé familiale: vaccinations, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée, de la fièvre et de la toux, visites prénatales et assistance à l'accouchement, allaitement maternel, et état nutritionnel des enfants de moins de cinq ans et de leurs mères par le biais des mesures du poids et de la taille; <br>- Fournir aux responsables et administrateurs des programmes de population au Sénégal des données de base actualisées sur la fécondité, la mortalité, la planification familiale et la santé. <br><br>De telles données ne sont pas seulement utiles pour évaluer l'impact de leurs activités, mais elles sont également importantes pour planifier de nouvelles stratégies pour l'amélioration de la santé et le bien-être de la population. Enfin I'EDS-II faisant partie d'un programme international, ses résultats font partie d'une base de données utilisables, au niveau mondial, par les organismes et les chercheurs qui s'intéressent aux problèmes de population et de santé. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>- Au niveau des caractéristiques générales collectives, on note d'abord la forte prédominance des chefs de ménage de sexe masculin mais le pourcentage de femmes ayant ce statut n'est pas négligeable (16 pour cent). Les ménages sont de grande taille: ils comptent en moyenne 9 personnes. Les ménages ont en général des logements de type traditionnel (les sols sont dans 72 pour cent des cas en matériaux autres que du ciment ou de la moquette). Ils ont un accès très limité à certains services de base. Dans l'ensemble, moins de la moitié (47 pour cent) des ménages enquêtées ont accès à l'eau de robinet (eau courante) et un ménage sur quatre a de l'électricité (26 pour cent). En dehors de la radio disponible dans 70 pour cent des ménages, la télévision, le réfrigérateur et le vidéo ne sont accessibles qu'à une certaine catégorie des urbains (respectivement 34, 21 pour cent et 8 pour cent) tandis que le véhicule à usage domestique ne concerne que 8 pour cent des urbains. <br><br>- Le niveau de la fécondité reste élevé. Le taux brut de natalité (TBN) est évalué à 40 pour cent et l'indice synthétique de fécondité (ISF) à 6,0 enfants par femme pour la période de 1990-1992. Les enquêtes réalisées au cours de la période 1987-1992 montrent que sur 20 pays africains au Sud du Sahara, le Sénégal occupe le 13ème rang, l'Ouganda et le Niger étant au premier rang avec un ISF de 7,2 et le Soudan en dernière position avec 4,6 enfants. <br><br>- La nuptialité est précoce: 50 pour cent des femmes ont contracté leur premier mariage avant 17 ans. Mais un recul très sensible de la précocité des mariages est observé surtout parmi les femmes modernes (urbaines et instruites). <br><br>- Une autre caractéristique des mariages est la pratique de la polygamie qui concerne presque la moitié des femmes en union mais est moins fréquente parmi les urbaines et celles qui sont instruites. Il faut signaler enfin, que le mariage demeure encore le déterminant essentiel de l'activité sexuelle, mais un certain nombre de femmes débutent leur vie sexuelle avant le mariage. L'abstinence post-partum a une durée courte (médiane de 3,5 mois); par contre, l'aménorrhée post-partum est longue (médiane de 14,3 mois); ce qui résulte d'un allaitement prolongé (médiane de 20,1 mois) et intense. Ce qui conduit à une période de non- susceptibilité relativement longue (médiane de 16,2 mois). <br><br>- Les méthodes contraceptives sont actuellement connues de la grande majorité des femmes. La quasi- totalité des femmes urbaines et des femmes instruites connaissent au moins une méthode contraceptive moderne. <br><br>- Dans l'ensemble, une femme sur cinq (20 pour cent) a déclaré qu'elle ne désirait plus d'enfant tandis que deux femmes sur trois (70 pour cent) en voulaient plus. Le pourcentage de femmes ne désirant plus d'enfants augmente régulièrement avec le nombre d'enfants survivants (9 pour cent chez les femmes qui ont 3 enfants et à 51 pour cent chez celles qui en ont 6 ou plus). <br><br>- L'examen des données sur les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouchement montre que pour l'ensemble des naissances survenues au cours des cinq années précédant l'enquête, une mère sur cinq (21 pour cent contre 36 dans I'EDS-I) n'a consulté aucun professionnel de santé pendant sa grossesse.<br><br>- La quasi-totalité des enfants de moins de cinq ans ont été allaités. D'après les recommandations de l'OMS, tous les enfants ågés de moins de 4 mois doivent être sous allaitement maternel exclusif. Mais, les résultats de l'enquête montrent que l'allaitement exclusif est rare au Sénégal puisque moins de 6 pour cent des enfants âgés de 0-3 mois sont exclusivement allaités. <br><br>- Durant la période la plus récente (0-4 ans avant l'enquête), sur 1000 naissances, 68 enfants sont morts avant l'âge de 1 an; et sur 1000 enfants ayant atteint leur premier anniversaire, 68 sont morts avant d'atteindre cinq ans. On observe toujours un écart important dans les niveaux de mortalité entre les milieux urbain et rural. En effet, sur 1000 naissances, 55 enfants citadins accèdent avant l'âge d'un an, contre 87 en milieu rural. L'écart est encore plus grand pour la mortalité juvénile qui est deux fois plus important en milieu rural: 107 pour mille contre 50 pour mille en milieu urbain. Pour ce qui est de la mortalité infanto-juvénile, sur 1000 naissances, 102 enfants citadins décèdent avant d'atteindre cinq ans contre 184 en milieu rural. <br><br>- L'EDS-II a enfin apporté des informations sur la mortalité maternelle. Pour la période des 13 années ayant précédé l'enquête, c'est à dire entre 1979 et 1992, on estime que le taux de mortalité maternelle se situait entre 500 et 550 décès pour 100 000 naissances.",0049661,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Senegal - Enquête Sénégalaise sur les Indicateurs de Santé 1999,"L'Enquête Sénégalaise sur les Indicateurs de Santé (ESIS) a été initiée par le Gouvernement du Sénégal qui a perçu la nécessité de disposer de données fiables pour l'évaluation et la mise en œuvre de son Programme de Développement Intégré de la Santé (PDIS) qui constitue la première phase quinquennale du Plan National de Développement Sanitaire et Social (PNDS). <br><br>Les objectifs prioritaires du PDIS sont : la réduction de la mortalité des cinq premières années de l'enfance, la réduction de la mortalité maternelle et la maîtrise de la fécondité. Les dix stratégies définies pour atteindre les objectifs du PDIS se regroupent en trois axes : l'amélioration de la qualité de la couverture sanitaire, l'amélioration de la qualité des services, et l'assainissement du cadre juridique et réglementaire. <br><br>Toute planification nécessite un accompagnement par un système d'évaluation performant afin d'éclairer les décisions en vue de l'accroissement des performances. Les indicateurs conçus pour la gestion et l'évaluation du PDIS peuvent être regroupés en trois catégories : les indicateurs d'accès aux soins, les indicateurs de qualité et de couverture des services et les indicateurs d'impact. Certains de ces indicateurs, notamment les indicateurs d'impact, sont disponibles à partir différentes enquêtes démographiques nationales : ESF de 1978, EDS-I de 1986, EDS-II de 1992-93 et EDS-III de 1997. Cependant, les données relatives à ces enquêtes, sauf la dernière, sont déjà assez anciennes pour refléter la situation actuelle. L'EDS-III de 1997, la plus récente, celle qui pourrait servir de référence pour établir un diagnostic ne couvre, malheureusement, qu'une partie des indicateurs du PDIS, à savoir : la fécondité, la mortalité et la prévalence et le traitement des maladies diarrhéiques. <br><br>Les autres indicateurs relatifs à la couverture adéquate en consultation prénatale (CPN), la nutrition, la mortalité maternelle, l'utilisation des services curatifs et la couverture vaccinale n'ont pas fait l'objet d'investigation lors de l'EDS-III. Les données les plus récentes sur la nutrition et la couverture vaccinale datent de 1992-93, (EDS-II). Les données de routine qui devraient servir pour le suivi et l'évaluation du PDIS n'étant pas disponibles, il s'avère nécessaire de mener une enquête axée essentiellement sur les indicateurs de ce programme. <br><br>Pour pallier à cette insuffisance, la présente enquête a collecté les informations nécessaires à l'évaluation de certains indicateurs afin de mieux apprécier les progrès réalisés par le PDIS. Ainsi, l'enquête permettra dans certains cas d'actualiser des données déjà existantes ou de collecter des informations nouvelles n'ayant pas fait l'objet d'investigations. <br><br>Les résultats de l'enquête devraient également servir à élaborer les plans opérationnels annuels au niveau régional et du district de santé. En effet, au niveau du district, le Médecin Chef de District (MCD) avec son équipe, élabore chaque année un plan d'action qui, après validation à l'occasion des revues annuelles, fait l'objet d'une requête de financement dans le cadre du PDIS. Les informations sur les indicateurs de santé devraient servir à orienter et définir les appuis des partenaires au développement qui participent au financement de la santé au niveau du district. L'enquête a été exécutée par le Groupe SERDHA avec l'appui technique de Macro International. Elle a bénéficié du financement de l'Agence des États-Unis pour le Développement International (USAID). La validation des travaux a été faite par un Comité de Pilotage composée de représentants du Ministère de la Santé notamment de la Direction des Études, de la Recherche et la Formation (DERF) et de la Cellule d'Appui et de Suivi du PNDS du Ministère de la Santé ainsi que de représentants de partenaires au développement. <br><br>Le principal objectif de la recherche est de fournir des indicateurs répondant aux besoins du Ministère de la Santé et de ses partenaires pour le suivi, l'évaluation et la planification des activités dans le secteur de la santé.

Senegal - Enquête Démographique  et de Santé 2005,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Sénégal (EDS-IV) est la quatrième enquête du genre réalisée dans le pays. L'EDS-IV est une enquête par sondage, représentative au niveau national, commanditée par le Gouvernement Sénégalais et conduite par le Centre de Recherche pour le Développement Humain (CRDH) avec l'assistance technique de ORC Macro, institution de coopération américaine en charge du programme international des Enquêtes Démographiques et de Santé (EDS). Le projet EDS-IV a été financé par le Gouvernement du Sénégal à travers un prêt de la Banque Mondiale ; il a bénéficié aussi de l'appui financier de l'Agence des Etats-Unis pour le Développement International (USAID), du Fonds des Nations Unies Pour l'Enfance (UNICEF) et du Fonds des Nations Unies Pour la Population (UNFPA).  <br><br>L'EDS-IV fournit des informations sur les niveaux de fécondité, l'activité sexuelle, les préférences en matière de fécondité, la connaissance et l'utilisation des méthodes de planification familiale, les pratiques d'allaitement, l'état nutritionnel des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans, la mortalité infantile, la mortalité maternelle, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant et sur la connaissance, les attitudes et les comportements vis-à-vis du sida et autres infections sexuellement transmissibles. De nouveaux volets inclus lors de la collecte portent sur la pratique de l'excision, l'utilisation des moustiquaires et les tests du VIH et de l'anémie. Les informations collectées au cours de l'EDS-IV permettent la mise à jour des indicateurs de base sur la situation démographique et sanitaire estimés lors des précédentes enquêtes de 1992, 1997 et 2000. <br><br>Au cours de l'enquête réalisée sur le terrain de février à mai 2005, 7412 ménages ont été enquêtés avec succès (soit un taux de réponse de 98,5 %) ; dans ces ménages, 14602 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans et 3761 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été interviewés avec succès et parmi ces enquêtés 4278 femmes de 15-49 ans et 3226 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été effectivement testés pour le VIH (échantillon pondéré). <br><br>Les informations recueillies dans l'enquête sont représentatives au niveau national, au niveau du milieu de résidence (urbain et rural) et au niveau des onze régions administratives. <br><br>L'EDS-IV a été effectuée auprès d'un échantillon de femmes en âge de procréation de 15 à 49 ans et d'hommes de 15 à 59 ans. Elle a pour objectifs de : <br>- recueillir des données au niveau régional qui permettront de calculer les taux démographiques, et en particulier les taux de fécondité, de mortalité générale et infantile ; <br>- analyser les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et les tendances de la fécondité ; <br>- mesurer les taux de connaissance et de pratique en matière de contraception par méthode selon la région ; <br>- évaluer les besoins non satisfaits en matière de contraception ; <br>- recueillir des informations sur la connaissance et les comportements en matière d'IST/VIH/sida ; <br>- recueillir des informations sur la pratique de l'excision ; <br>- recueillir des informations sur la santé familiale : vaccinations, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies d'enfants de moins de cinq ans, consultations prénatales, assistance pendant l'accouchement, allaitement maternel et consultations post-natales, prévention du paludisme ; <br>- collecter des informations sur la mortalité maternelle au niveau national ; <br>- recueillir des informations sur la disponibilité et l'accessibilité des services communautaires ; <br>- collecter des informations sur la nutrition (anthropométrie, alimentation), et l'anémie (test du sang) ; <br>- recueillir des informations sur la prévalence du VIH dans la population générale à partir des prélèvements de sang séché. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>- Niveau et tendance de la fécondité. Les données de l'EDS-IV montrent que la fécondité des femmes en 2005 demeure encore élevée au Sénégal. Avec les niveaux actuels, chaque femme donnerait naissance en moyenne à 5,3 enfants à la fin de sa vie féconde. Cette fécondité est également précoce puisque 19 % des filles de moins de 20 ans ont déjà eu au moins une naissance vivante ou étaient enceintes au moment de l'enquête. Cependant, la fécondité continue de baisser: l'indice synthétique de fécondité est passé de 6,6 enfants par femme en 1986, à 6,0 en 1992, 5,7 en 1997 et 5,3 en 2005. Au Sénégal, moins de 3,0 % seulement des femmes actuellement en union et âgées de 40 à 49 ans n'ont jamais eu d'enfant et pourraient être considérées comme stériles. <br><br>- Nuptialité : Parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans, 68 % étaient en union au moment de l'enquête. La proportion de femmes qui restent encore célibataires à 35-39 ans est de 4 % seulement ; à plus de 40 ans, elle est inférieure à 1 %. Ainsi, le mariage qui demeure le cadre privilégié de l'activité sexuelle (94 % des célibataires n'ont jamais eu de rapports sexuels) et de la procréation est pratiquement universel au Sénégal. En outre, la pratique de la polygamie est assez répandue ; quatre femmes sur dix (40 %) sont en union polygame.<br><br>- Planification Familiale : Connaissance des méthodes contraceptives. Bien que la connaissance des méthodes contraceptives soit généralisée (plus de 90 % connaissent au moins une méthode moderne), peu de femmes les utilisent (10 % des femmes en union utilisent actuellement une méthode moderne).<br><br>- Santé de la Mère : Soins prénatals. En ce qui concerne les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouche­ment, on constate que pour la grande majorité (83 %) des naissances survenues dans les 5 années précédant l'enquête, les mères ont effectué au moins une visite prénatale auprès de personnel qualifié et 40 % en ont fait quatre ou plus. Plus d'une mère sur cinq (22 %) a été protégée contre le tétanos néonatal par une dose de vaccin antitétanique (VAT) et deux mères sur trois en ont reçu deux ou plus. Plus de six naissances sur dix (62 %) se sont déroulées dans un établissement sanitaire 52 % d'entre elles ont bénéficié de l'assistance de personnel de santé au moment de l'accouchement. Les femmes urbaines ont été relativement plus nombreuses à avoir reçu quatre consultations prénatales ou plus (51 % contre 33 % en milieu rural). Par ailleurs, les femmes rurales (52 %), celles sans niveau d'instruction (46 %), celles résidant dans les régions de Kolda et de Tambacounda (65 %), celles appartenant aux ménages les plus pauvres (70 %) et celles n'ayant reçu aucun soin prénatal (86 %) ont, beaucoup plus fréquemment que les autres, accouché à domicile. <br><br>- Santé de l'enfant : Allaitement des enfants. Plus de neuf enfants SANTÉ DE L'ENFANT  sur dix (96 %) nés durant les cinq années ayant précédé l'enquête ont été allaités. Bien que la Vaccination des enfants. Pour la majorité des enfants (80 %) soient allaités dans les 24 couverture vaccinale des enfants, on relève que heures qui ont suivi leur naissance, 48 % ont reçu des aliments avant le début de l'allaitement. L'assistance à l'accouchement et partant, le lieu où celui-ci s'est déroulé, influe légèrement sur le début de l'allaitement. En effet, quand la mère a accouché dans une formation sanitaire, 83 % ont été allaités dans les 24 heures qui ont suivi leur naissance, contre 76 % de ceux dont la mère a accouché à domicile. <br><br>- Mortalité infantiles : Niveau de mortalité. La mortalité infanto­juvénile reste élevée au plan national. Pour la période la plus récente (0-4 ans avant l'enquête), les résultats montrent que sur 1 000 naissances vivantes, 61 meurent avant d'atteindre leur premier anniversaire (35 ‰ entre 0 et 1 mois exact et 26 ‰ entre 1 et 12 mois exacts) ; sur 1 000 enfants âgés d'un an, 64 n'atteignent pas leur cinquième anniversaire. <br>Globalement, le risque de décès entre la naissance et le cinquième anniversaire est de 121 pour 1000 naissances, soit environ un enfant sur huit. <br><br>- La mortalité maternelle est l'indicateur de santé montrant la plus grande disparité entre les pays en développement et les pays développés. En Afrique subsaharienne, une femme a une chance sur 12 de mourir au cours d'une grossesse ou d'un accouchement contre une chance sur 4 000 dans les pays riches.<br> <br>- Prévalence. La pratique de l'excision est assez répandue au Sénégal puisque qu'elle concerne 28 % des femmes de 15-49 ans. La pratique de l'excision est essentiellement déterminée par l'appartenance ethnique. Dans deux des principaux groupes ethniques, à savoir les Wolof et les Serer, le pourcentage de femmes excisées n'atteint pas 2 %. Chez les Soninké, les Mandingue, les Poular et les Diola, il varie de 60 à 78 %. <br><br>- Prévalence du VIH : Taux de couverture. Les résultats de l'EDS­IV indiquent que plus de huit personnes sur dix ont consenti à donner quelques gouttes de leur sang pour être testées sur le VIH. Le taux de couverture est plus élevé chez les femmes (85 %) que chez les hommes (76 %). Les taux d'acceptation chez les femmes et les hommes du milieu rural sont nettement plus élevés que chez ceux du milieu urbain. Dans l'ensemble, 83 % des personnes dans les zones rurales ont accepté, contre 78 % chez celles des villes. Enfin, les meilleurs taux de couverture ont été observés dans les régions Diourbel et Kolda (89 %) et les plus bas concernent Matam (71 %), Dakar (73 %) et Saint-Louis (74 %).",0049651,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Senegal - Enquête Démographique et de Santé à Indicateurs Multiples 2010-2011,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé du Sénégal (EDS-MICS), fait suite aux EDS de 1986, 1992, 1997 et 2005.

Rwanda - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1992,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Rwanda (EDSR) a été exécutée par l'Office National de la Population (ONAPO) avec l'assistance technique de Macro International Inc. Il s'agit d'une enquête par sondage réalisée au niveau national, dont l'objectif est de fournir des informations détaillées sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant et la mortalité infanto-juvénile. Faisant suite à l'Enquête Nationale sur la Fécondité (ENF) réalisée par I'ONAPO en 1983 et au Recensement Général de la Population et de l'Habitat (RGPH) de 1991, les résultats de I'EDSR permettent de mettre en lumière les changements intervenus au Rwanda durant ces dernières années, en particulier en ce qui concerne les niveaux de fécondité, de connaissance et d'utilisation de la planification familiale et ceux de mortalité infanto-juvénile. Au cours de I'EDSR, dont les travaux de collecte se sont déroules de juin à octobre 1992, 6 252 ménages, 6 551 femmes en âge de procréer (15-49 ans) et 598 maris appartenant à ces ménages ont été enquêtes avec succès sur l'ensemble du territoire national. <br><br>L'EDSR est une enquête par sondage dont l'objectif principal est de recueillir, à l'échelle nationale, des données fiables et de qualité permettant de : <br><br>- calculer certains taux démographiques et, plus particulièrement, les taux de fécondité et de mortalité infantile ; <br>- analyser les facteurs qui déterminent le niveau et les tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité ; <br>- estimer les niveaux de connaissance et de pratique de la contraception chez les femmes en åge de procréer et chez leur mari ; <br>- connaître les préférences en matière de fécondité et l'attitude envers la planification familiale des femmes et de leur mari ; <br>- évaluer la situation de la santé maternelle et infantile en ce qui concerne les vaccinations, la prévalence et le traitement de la diarrhée et des maladies respiratoires, les pratiques d'allaitement, les soins prénatals et l'assistance à l'accouchement ; <br>- évaluer l'état nutritionnel des enfants de moins de 5 ans à partir des mesures anthropométriques. <br><br>Grâce à l'expérience acquise par les cadres durant I'EDSR, ce projet vise également h renforcer les capacités du Rwanda, en général, et de I'ONAPO, en particulier, pour réaliser des études similaires dans le futur. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>Avec les niveaux actuels de la fécondité, les femmes rwandaises donneront naissance, en moyenne, à 6,2 enfants durant leur vie féconde. Bien que cette fécondité reste élevée, elle a fortement diminué au cours des dernières années puisque, selon I'ENF de 1983, les femmes avaient, en moyenne, 8,5 enfants. La fécondité a donc connu une baisse de 27 pour cent en moins de 10 ans. La forte proportion de femmes célibataires, le recul de l'âge au premier mariage et aux premiers rapports sexuels et l'augmentation de la prévalence contraceptive sont autant de facteurs qui expliquent cette baisse. En outre, les niveaux de fécondité varient fortement en fonction de la résidence et du niveau d'instruction. Les femmes du milieu urbain (4,5 enfants) donnent naissance à près de deux enfants de moins que les femmes du milieu rural (6,3 enfants). Les femmes ayant dépassé le niveau d'instruction primaire (4,3 enfants) ont, en moyenne, plus d'un enfant de moins que celles ayant seulement un niveau d'instruction primaire (5,9 enfants), et près de trois enfants de moins que celles qui n'ont jamais fréquenté l'école (7,0 enfants). Du point de vue régional, la fécondité varie d'un minimum de 5,2 enfants dans les préfectures de Butare/Gitarama à un maximum de 7,2 dans les préfectures de Kibuye/Ruhengeri/Gisenyi. <br><br>Au moment de l'enquête, 10 pour cent des adolescentes de 15-19 ans avaient déjà eu, au moins, un enfant ou étaient enceintes pour la première fois. En outre, cette proportion d'adolescentes ayant commencé leur vie féconde varie fortement selon la région (de 7 pour cent à Butare/Gitarama, à 16 pour cent à Byumba/Kibungo), et selon le niveau d'instruction (de 3 pour cent chez les adolescentes ayant dépassé le niveau d'instruction primaire, à 22 pour cent chez celles sans instruction). Ce sont les catégories de femmes chez lesquelles se rencontrent ces fortes proportions d'adolescentes mères ou enceintes qui ont les niveaux les plus élevés de fécondité. <br><br>Parmi les femmes enquêtées, la proportion des célibataires est importante : 32 pour cent ont déclaré n'avoir jamais été en union. De même, on observe une forte proportion de femmes en rupture d'union, soit par veuvage (4 pour cent), soit par divorce ou séparation (6 pour cent). Ainsi, au total, 42 pour cent des femmes de 15-49 ans n'étaient pas en union au moment de l'enquête. A 20-24 ans, 45 pour cent des femmes sont encore célibataires, et l'âge médian d'entrée en union est de plus en plus tardif : il est passé de 18,7 ans chez les femmes des générations les plus anciennes, âgées de 45-49 ans à l'enquête, å 20,9 ans chez celles de 25-29 ans. De même, dans les générations récentes âgées de 25-29 ans à l'enquête, les premiers rapports sexuels se produisent plus tardivement (médiane de 20,2 ans) que dans les générations anciennes (médiane de 18,4 ans). Ces changements de comportement en matière d'union et de rapports sexuels expliquent, en grande partie, la baisse de la fécondité observée récemment. <br><br>Depuis I'ENF (1983), la connaissance de la contraception s'est très nettement améliorée : 67 pour cent de femmes connaissaient une méthode quelconque de contraception en 1983, contre 98 pour cent en 1992 pour les seules méthodes modernes. En outre, parmi les femmes en union qui déclarent connaitre une méthode, 92 pour cent savent où se la procurer. Plus d'une femme sur cinq utilisait la contraception au moment de l'enquête. Parmi les méthodes modernes, les injections (8 pour cent) et la pilule (3 pour cent) sont les plus utilis6es; parmi les méthodes traditionnelles, c'est la continence périodique (5 pour cent) et le retrait (3 pour cent) qui sont les plus pratiquées. Le condom reste très peu utilise (moins de 1 pour cent). Depuis 1983, la pr6valence contraceptive a fortement augmenté, en particulier pour les méthodes modernes, passant de 1 à 13 pour cent. Le développement de la contraception, et surtout des méthodes modernes, est un autre facteur important expliquant la baisse de la fécondité observée récemment. <br><br>Comme pour la fécondité, les niveaux d'utilisation de la contraception varient selon le milieu de résidence et le niveau d'instruction : 13 pour cent des femmes du milieu rural utilisent une méthode moderne contre 20 pour cent en milieu urbain. De même, l'utilisation de la contraception moderne varie de 11 pour cent chez les femmes sans instruction à 28 pour cent chez celles qui ont un niveau d'instruction supérieur au primaire. Cependant, 93 pour cent des femmes en union qui connaissent une méthode contraceptive approuvent la planification familiale, et la diffusion d'informations à ce sujet dans les média est approuvée par 95 pour cent. <br><br>Plus d'un tiers des femmes rwandaises en union et plus d'un tiers de leur mari partagent le même désir de limiter leur descendance : ils ont exprimé le souhait de ne plus avoir d'enfants. Si toutes les grossesses non désirées étaient évitées, la fécondité totale serait de 4,2 enfants, soit 2 enfants de moins que la fécondité actuelle. Ce niveau de fécondité désirée (4,2 enfants) correspond également au nombre idéal d'enfants exprimé par les femmes et leurs matis. On estime que 40 pour cent des femmes en union ont des besoins non-satisfaits en matière de planification familiale. Si ces besoins étaient satisfaits, la prévalence contraceptive pourrait atteindre 62 pour cent. Ces résultats laissent présager que la baisse de la fécondité amorcée se poursuivra dans les années à venir. <br><br>L'EDSR fournit aussi un ensemble d'informations très importantes sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant ainsi que sur l'état nutritionnel des enfants. <br><br>Concernant les soins prénatals, on constate que, quelles que soient les caractéristiques de la mère, 92 à 99 pour cent des naissances des cinq années ayant précédé l'enquête ont donné lieu à des consultations prénatales. Par ailleurs, dans 9 cas sur 10, la mère a reçu au moins une injection antitétanique pendant la grossesse. Cependant, trois naissances sur quatre ont lieu à la maison et une naissance sur cinq se déroule sans l'assistance de professionnels de la santé. En outre, on constate d'énormes différences du point de vue du niveau d'instruction de la mère et du milieu de résidence : 67 pour cent des naissances du milieu urbain ont lieu en formation sanitaire contre 23 pour cent en milieu rural, et 65 pour cent des naissances des femmes ayant une instruction supérieure au primaire se sont d6roulées avec l'assistance de professionnels de la santé, contre seulement 18 pour cent des naissances chez les femmes sans instruction. <br><br>D'après les déclarations des mères et selon les renseignements tirés des carnets de vaccination, la grande majorité des enfants de 12-23 mois (87 pour cent) ont reçu tous les vaccins du Programme Elargi de Vaccination (PEV) et, pour 83 pour cent des enfants, ces vaccinations ont été faites conformément au calendrier vaccinal recommandé par l'OMS. Cette couverture vaccinale est assez uniformément répartie selon le milieu de résidence, la région et le niveau d'instruction puisqu'elle ne varie que de 83 à 95 pour cent selon les différents groupes de mères. <br><br>En ce qui concerne les maladies de l'enfance, 33 pour cent des enfants de moins de cinq ans ont présenté des sympt0mes d'infections respiratoires aiguës (toux et respiration courte et rapide), 42 pour cent ont eu de la fièvre et 23 pour cent ont eu un ou plusieurs épisodes diarrhéiques, pendant les deux semaines qui ont précédé l'enquête. Quelle que soit la maladie, moins d'un tiers des enfants ont été conduits en consultation lorsqu'ils étaient malades. En outre, environ 3 enfants sur 10 n'ont reçu aucun traitement pendant leur maladie; pour ceux qui ont reçu un traitement, il s'agissait le plus fréquemment de remèdes traditionnels. Parmi les enfants atteints de diarrhée, la moitié d'entre eux n'a bénéficié d'aucune forme de réhydratation par voie orale, alors que la grande majorité des femmes connaissent les sels de réhydratation orale (85 pour cent). <br><br>La quasi totalité des enfants rwandais nés au cours des cinq années ayant précédé l'enquête ont été allaités (97 pour cent), et cela sur une longue période, puisque un enfant sur deux est allaité pendant pr~s de 28 mois. Cependant, seulement 18 pour cent des enfants sont mis au sein immédiatement après la naissance. En outre, contrairement aux recommandations de l'OMS selon lesquelles un enfant ne doit recevoir rien d'autre que le sein jusqu'à 4-6 mois, un enfant sur trois reçoit des compléments nutritionnels à l'âge de 4-5 mois. A l'opposé, parmi les enfants de 6-7 mois pour lesquels le lait maternel seul n'est plus suffisant à leur alimentation, un sur trois ne reçoit pas d'aliment de complément. <br><br>Près de la moitié des enfants rwandais de moins de cinq ans souffrent de sous-nutrition chronique qui se manifeste par un retard de croissance. Cette forme de sous-nutrition augmente avec l'âge pour atteindre 54 pour cent des enfants de 12-23 mois et pour se maintenir ensuite autour de 50 à 60 pour cent. Par ailleurs, 7 pour cent des enfants de 12-23 mois souffrent de sous-nutrition aiguë qui se manifeste par l'émaciation. <br><br>Malgré des résultats très satisfaisants dans le domaine des soins prénatals et de la vaccination des enfants, la forte prévalence des maladies de l'enfance et leur manque de traitement explique que la mortalité des enfants rwandais reste toujours élevée. Sur mille enfants qui naissent vivants, 85 décèdent avant le premier anniversaire, et sur mille enfants qui atteignent un an, 72 meurent avant d'atteindre 5 ans. Globalement, la mortalité infanto-juvénile touche 150 enfants pour mille naissances vivantes. Ces niveaux de mortalité ont néanmoins nettement diminué au cours des 15 dernières années : depuis la fin des années 1970, où elle était estimée ~t 225 pour mille, la mortalité infanto-juvénile aurait baissé de 44 pour cent. <br><br>Les niveaux de mortalité présentent d'assez faibles variations selon le milieu de résidence des mères, la mortalité infanto-juvénile variant de 163 pour mille en milieu rural à 155 pour mille en milieu urbain. Par contre, les enfants de mères sans instruction courent près de deux fois plus de risques de décéder avant l'âge de 5 ans que ceux dont la mère a un niveau d'instruction supérieur au primaire. Par ailleurs, les enfants nés de mères très jeunes (moins de 20 ans) sont plus exposes å la mortalité infantile (121 pour mille) que ceux nés de mères plus âgées (90 pour mille ou moins); de même, les intervalles intergénésiques très courts sont associés à une mortalité infantile (159 pour 1 000) près de trois fois plus élevée que celle associée aux intervalles intergénésiques de quatre ans ou plus (57 pour mille). Ainsi, la fécondité précoce et des grossesses trop rapprochées contribuent au maintien d'une mortalité élev6ee parmi les enfants.",0049606,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Rwanda - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 2000,"La deuxième Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Rwanda (EDSR-II) est une enquête par sondage, représentative au niveau national. Elle a été exécutée par l'Office National de Population (ONAPO), avec l'assistance technique de ORC Macro, à l'aide de financements de l'USAID, du FNUAP et de l'UNICEF. L'EDSR-II fournit des informations détaillées sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la santé maternelle et infantile, l'état nutritionnel des enfants et des mères, la mortalité infanto­juvénile, les Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et le sida. Au cours de l'enquête, réalisée sur le terrain de juin à novembre 2000, 9 696 ménages, 10 421 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans et 2 717 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été interviewés avec succès. <br><br>Les informations recueillies sont significatives au niveau national, au niveau du milieu de résidence (Kigali Ville, Autres Villes et rural) et au niveau des préfectures pour un nombre non négligeable d'indicateurs. <br><br>L'EDSR-II a pour objectif d'estimer de nombreux indicateurs socio-économiques, démographiques et sanitaires au niveau de l'ensemble de la population et au niveau des sous­populations des femmes de 15-49 ans, des enfants de moins de 5 ans et des hommes de 15-59 ans.",0049604,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Rwanda - Enquête Démographique et de Santé Rwanda 2005,"L'EDSR-III vient après celles menées successivement en 1992 et en 2000 et s'intègre dans un vaste programme mondial d'Enquêtes sociodémographiques et sanitaires menées depuis le milieu des années 1980 dans les pays en développement.<br><br>Au total, 10644 ménages ont été sélectionnés pour l'EDSR-III et, parmi eux, 10307 ménages ont été identifiés au moment de l'enquête. Parmi ces 10307 ménages, 10272 ont pu être enquêtés avec succès, soit un taux de réponse de presque 100 %. À l'intérieur des 10272 ménages enquêtés, 11539 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans ont été identifiées comme étant éligibles pour l'enquête individuelle, et pour 11321 d'entre elles, l'interview a pu être menée à bien. Le taux de réponse s'établit donc à 98 % pour les interviews auprès des femmes. L'enquête homme a été réalisée dans un ménage sur deux : au total 4959 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été identifiés dans les ménages du sous-échantillon. Parmi ces 4959 hommes devant être interviewés individuellement, 4 820 ont été enquêtés avec succès, soit un taux de réponse de 97 %. <br><br>L'EDSR-III a pour objectifs principaux de : <br>- recueillir des données à l'échelle nationale qui permettent de calculer des taux démographiques essentiels, plus particulièrement les taux de fécondité et de mortalité infantile et infanto-juvénile et d'analyser les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent le niveau et la tendance de la fécondité et de la mortalité infanto-juvénile ; <br>- mesurer les niveaux de connaissance et de pratique contraceptive des femmes et des hommes ; <br>- recueillir des données sur la santé familiale : vaccination, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée, des Infections des Voies Respiratoires Aiguës (IRA) et de la fièvre chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans, visites prénatales et assistance à l'accouchement ; <br>- recueillir des données sur la prévention et sur le traitement du paludisme, en particulier la possession et l'utilisation de moustiquaires, la prévention du paludisme chez les femmes enceintes ; <br>- recueillir des données sur les pratiques nutritionnelles des enfants, y compris l'allaitement, et, dans la moitié des ménages de l'enquête, prendre des mesures anthropométriques pour évaluer l'état nutritionnel des femmes et des enfants, et réaliser un test d'anémie auprès des enfants de moins de cinq ans, des femmes de 15-49 ans et des hommes de 15-59 ans ; <br>- recueillir des données sur la connaissance et les attitudes des femmes et des hommes au sujet des IST et du sida et évaluer les modifications récentes de comportement du point de vue de l'utilisation du condom ; <br>- recueillir des données permettant d'estimer, à l'échelle nationale, le niveau de la mortalité adulte ; <br>- recueillir des données de qualité sur la violence domestique ; <br>- recueillir des données sur les soins et le support apportés aux personnes âgés de moins de 60 ans qui sont décédées au cours des 12 mois précédant l'enquête ; <br>- effectuer des prélèvements de sang dans la moitié des ménages de l'enquête pour le dépistage anonyme du VIH auprès des femmes de 15-49 ans et des hommes de 15-59 ans afin d'estimer la prévalence du VIH dans la population adulte d'âge reproductif. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>Les résultats de l'enquête montrent que 44 % des femmes avaient entre 15 et 24 ans et 43 % des hommes avaient entre 15 et 24 ans au moment de l'enquête. En plus, deux femmes sur cinq et environ un homme sur deux étaient célibataires. Cette situation montre que la population rwandaise est très jeune et ceci doit attirer une attention particulière des décideurs dans l'élaboration et la mise en œuvre des politiques nationales de développement. La proportion des femmes n'ayant reçu aucune instruction formelle (23 %) est plus élevée que celle des hommes (17 %). Seulement 10 % des femmes et 12 % des hommes ont atteint un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus. On constate aussi que les proportions d'hommes et de femmes qui ne savent pas lire sont respectivement 22 % et 29 %. Aussi, au niveau national plus de deux femmes sur cinq (44 %) et environ un homme sur cinq (19 %) ne sont exposés à aucun média. Seulement 8 % des femmes contre 10 % des hommes ont déclaré lire un journal au moins une fois par semaine.  <br><br>Très peu de ménages rwandais disposent de l'électricité (5 %) ; en milieu rural, moins de 2 % des ménages disposent de l'électricité contre 25 % en milieu urbain. Pour l'approvisionnement en eau de boisson, 39 % des ménages urbains et 71 % des ménages ruraux ne consomment pas de l'eau potable (eau de robinet, forage ou puits protégés). En ce qui concerne les toilettes, deux ménages sur trois (67 %) utilisent les latrines non couvertes. Dans l'ensemble, 5 % des ménages ne possèdent pas de toilettes.  <br><br>FÉCONDITÉ <br><br>L'analyse des données de l'EDSR-III de 2005 montre que la fécondité des femmes rwandaises reste élevée. L'Indice Synthétique de Fécondité est de 6,1 enfants par femme pour l'ensemble des femmes, de 4,9 enfants par femme en milieu urbain et de 6,3 enfants par femme en milieu rural.  <br><br>Le niveau d'instruction, le milieu de résidence, l'état matrimonial et le niveau de vie sont des facteurs remarquables de différenciation de la fécondité au Rwanda. Les provinces du Nord et de l'Ouest accusent une forte fécondité tandis que celles du sud se caractérisent par une fécondité relativement faible. <br><br>La fécondité des adolescentes est négligeable, elle ne contribue que pour 3 % à la fécondité totale. La fécondité des femmes âgées de plus de 40 ans représente 12 % de la fécondité totale. Quant à la fécondité passée, les parités moyennes à 40-49 ans se situent à 6,6 enfants par femme pour l'ensemble des femmes, 5,8 enfants par femme en milieu urbain et 6,7 enfants par femme en milieu rural. <br><br>La fécondité aux âges extrêmes (15-19 ans et 40-49 ans) décroît d'une enquête à l'autre. Ce sont les femmes de 20 à 39 ans qui contribuent le plus à l'augmentation de la fécondité.  <br><br>S'agissant enfin de l'évolution du phénomène, on a observé que la fécondité se stabilise depuis 1992 autour de 6 enfants par femme. <br><br>PLANIFICATION FAMILIALE <br><br>Connaissance des méthodes contraceptives. Bien que la quasi-totalité des femmes en union connaissent les méthodes contraceptives (98 % en 2005 contre 97 % en 2000), et en particulier les méthodes modernes (98 % en 2005 contre 97 % en 2000), très peu de femmes les utilisent. <br><br>Prévalence contraceptive. La prévalence contraceptive des femmes en union est seulement de 17 %, toutes méthodes confondues, et de 10 % pour les méthodes modernes. Parmi les femmes en union, la proportion des utilisatrices a augmenté au cours des cinq dernières années ayant précédé l'enquête, passant de 13 % en 2000 à 17 % en 2005 pour l'ensemble des méthodes et de 4 % en 2000 à 10 % en 2005 pour les seules méthodes modernes. Les méthodes modernes les plus utilisées étaient les injectables (5 %) et la pilule (2 %). Les résultats de l'enquête montrent que la prévalence est plus faible parmi les jeunes femmes de 15-24 ans (7 % au plus) et parmi les plus âgées de 45-49 ans (10 %). <br><br>Chez les hommes, la connaissance des méthodes contraceptives est également universelle : 98 % des hommes ont déclaré connaître, au moins, une méthode moderne contre 77 % pour les méthodes traditionnelles. <br><br>NUPTIALITÉ <br><br>Parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans, 49 % étaient en union au moment de l'enquête, la proportion des femmes célibataires diminuent avec l'âge et il est très rare de trouver des femmes célibataires après 45 ans (2 %). Ainsi le mariage, qui demeure le cadre pratiquement exclusif de la procréation au Rwanda est très répandu. En outre, 12 % des femmes sont en union polygame. Les filles rwandaises se marient très tardivement ; seulement 19 % des femmes qui ont entre 25-49 ans ont contracté leur première union avant d'atteindre l'âge de 18 ans. L'âge médian des femmes à la première union est de 20,7 ans et l'âge aux premiers rapports sexuels est de 20,3 ans.  <br>Les hommes contractent leur première union à un âge plus avancé que les femmes ; l'âge médian à la première union étant de 25,0 ans et l'âge aux premiers rapports sexuels est de 20,8 ans.<br> <br>PRÉFÉRENCE EN MATIÈRE DE ÉCONDITÉ <br><br>Concernant la préférence en matière de fécondité, 42 % des femmes ont exprimé le souhait de ne plus avoir d'enfants, alors que plus de la moitié (52 %) en souhaiteraient davantage. Parmi ces dernières, 12 % voudraient avoir la prochaine naissance bientôt, 39 % voudraient un enfant plus tard et 2 % souhaiteraient avoir un autre enfant, mais ne précisent pas quand. La proportion d'hommes qui ne veulent plus d'enfants est pratiquement similaire à celle des femmes (44 %). En outre, 40 % des hommes désirent avoir un autre enfant plus tard.  <br><br>Le nombre idéal moyen d'enfants pour l'ensemble des femmes et pour les femmes en union au moment de l'enquête s'établit autour de 4. Ce nombre idéal est inférieur à l'ISF (6,1), ce qui explique le désir de ces femmes d'avoir une descendance moins nombreuse. <br><br>SANTÉ DE LA MÈRE ET DE L'ENFANT  <br><br>Consultations prénatales. La grande majorité des mères effectuent des consultations prénatales (94 %). Cependant, seulement 13 % des mères respectent les normes de l'OMS et du pays, soit de faire au moins quatre visites durant la grossesse. La première visite de consultation prénatale a lieu tardivement au Rwanda ; le nombre médian de mois de grossesse à la première visite étant estimé à 6,4. <br><br>Au cours des visites prénatales, très peu de femmes sont informées des signes de complications de la grossesse (6 %). La mesure du poids et la prise de la tension artérielle sont les mesures les plus fréquemment effectuées pendant les consultations prénatales, respectivement, 94 % et 71 %. Pour plus de la moitié des femmes (56 %), on a également effectué la mesure de la taille alors que les autres examens de routine comme le prélèvement de sang ou de l'urine sont rarement effectués durant les consultations. Une faible proportion de femmes ont pris le fer et les médicaments antipaludéens, soit respectivement, 28 % et 6 %. <br><br>Accouchement. Un grand nombre de femmes accouchent à domicile au Rwanda (70 %). Six femmes sur dix ne sont pas assistées par du personnel formé et parmi elles, 43 % sont assistées par des accoucheuses traditionnelles non formées. Notons aussi que 17 % des femmes accouchent sans aucune assistance. <br><br>Vaccination des enfants. L'objectif du PEV au Rwanda qui vise à faire vacciner tous les enfants avant l'âge de 12 mois n'est pas encore atteint. En effet, seulement 75 % des enfants de 12-23 mois ont reçu tous les vaccins. Parmi ces enfants, 69 % avaient reçu tous les vaccins avant 12 mois. Le taux de déperdition entre la première dose et la troisième dose est élevé pour les vaccins de DTCoq (10 %) et de polio (13 %).  <br><br>Maladies des enfants. L'EDSR-III a révélé que 17 % des enfants de moins de 5 ans ont souffert de toux accompagnée de respiration courte et rapide, que 26 % ont eu de la fièvre et que 14 % ont eu la diarrhée au cours des deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête. <br><br>Des traitements ou des conseils ont été recherchés pour 27 % des enfants ayant souffert de toux accompagnée de respiration courte et rapide ou de la fièvre. De même, seulement 14 % des enfants ayant souffert de la diarrhée ont été soignés. <br><br>Les sachets SRO, utilisés pour réhydrater les enfants souffrant de la diarrhée, sont connus par une grande partie des mères (87 %), surtout celles plus âgées. Pendant les épisodes diarrhéiques, seulement 32 % des enfants ont reçu soit une SRO, soit une solution maison ou encore un apport plus important en liquides. Une proportion non moins important a été soigné traditionnellement ; ce qui est le plus inquiétant c'est que 33 % des enfants n'ont reçu aucun traitement. <br><br>NUTRITION <br><br>Pratiques d'allaitement. L'allaitement est universel et assez prolongé au Rwanda : les résultats montrent que la quasi totalité des enfants de moins de six mois sont allaités, et de plus, 97 % des enfants de 10 à 11 mois sont encore au sein. La recom­mandation d'allaitement exclusif pour les enfants de moins de six mois est respectée par près de neuf mères sur dix (88 %). La durée médiane de l'allaitement est de 24,9 mois. <br><br>En outre, l'introduction d'autres liquides ou suppléments chez les nouveau-nés de moins de deux mois est assez rare (5 %). Toutefois, la recom­mandation relative à l'introduction d'aliments solides de complément à partir de six mois n'est pas suffisamment respectée : seulement 69 % des enfants de 6 à 9 mois reçoivent des suppléments de nourriture. <br><br>État nutritionnel. Dans l'ensemble, plus de quatre enfants de moins de cinq ans sur dix souffrent d'une malnutrition chronique (45 %) dont près d'un enfant sur cinq (19 %) sous sa forme sévère. Le niveau du retard de croissance augmente rapidement avec l'âge, étant le plus élevé parmi les enfants de 12 à 23 mois (55 %), et demeurant élevé (51 à 53 %) parmi les enfants plus âgés. Le niveau du retard de croissance est le plus élevé parmi les enfants du Nord (52 %). Par ailleurs, il diminue légèrement avec le niveau d'instruction de la mère : 50 % chez les enfants des mères sans instruction, 44 % chez celles de niveau primaire et 43 % chez celles de niveau secondaire ou plus. <br><br>Les résultats montrent que 4 % des enfants sont émaciés, et 1 % le sont sévèrement. Autrement dit, ces enfants souffrent de malnutrition aiguë. Le niveau d'émaciation est le plus élevé (9 %) pour les enfants de 12 à 23 mois, correspondant à la période au cours de laquelle on observe une intensification de sevrage et une plus grande exposition de l'enfant aux maladies (par exemple, celles liées à l'introduc­tion de nouveaux aliments non hygiéniques, à l'exploration de l'environnement immédiat en rampant par terre, etc.). Au niveau provincial, paradoxalement, l'émaciation la plus élevée pour les enfants est observée dans la Ville de Kigali (8 %).  <br><br>Aussi, il ressort des résultats que 22 % des enfants au Rwanda présentent une insuffisance pondérale et 4 % sous sa forme sévère. Cet indice reflète les deux précédentes formes de malnutrition, chronique et aiguë. <br><br>Au niveau national, 56 % des enfants de 6-59 mois sont atteints d'anémie sous une forme quelconque : 20 % sous une forme légère ; 27 % sous une forme modérée et 9 % sous une forme sévère. En général, les enfants des zones urbaines et ceux des zones rurales souffrent également de l'anémie, excepté l'anémie sévère pour laquelle les enfants du milieu urbain montrent un taux plus élevé que ceux du milieu rural (13 % et 8 % respective­ment). De même, les résultats indiquent que ce sont les enfants de la Ville de Kigali qui souffrent le plus de l'anémie, et surtout sous sa forme sévère.  <br><br>Les femmes au Rwanda sont moins touchées par l'anémie que les enfants. Au niveau national, 33 % des femmes souffrent de l'anémie : 19 % sous sa forme légère; 11 % sous sa forme modérée et 3 % sous sa forme sévère. Comme pour les enfants, les femmes des zones urbaines et celles des zones rurales souffrent de l'anémie au même degré. De même, comme pour les enfants de la Ville de Kigali, les femmes de la Ville de Kigali ont un taux d'anémie plus élevé que dans n'importe quelle autre province, surtout pour ce qui concerne l'anémie modérée et sévère.<br><br>PALUDISME <br><br>Possession des moustiquaires. Au Rwanda, 18 % des ménages possèdent au moins une moustiquaire. Le milieu urbain, surtout la Ville de Kigali, se démarque des autres provinces avec plus de 40 % des ménages possédant au moins une moustiquaire. De même, 45 % des ménages les plus riches possèdent au moins une moustiquaire contre 6 % des ménages les plus pauvres qui en possèdent au moins une. Cependant, seulement 6 % des ménages possèdent plus d'une moustiquaire.  <br><br>Dans l'ensemble, tous les ménages qui possèdent au moins une moustiquaire les ont imprégné à un moment quelconque. Par contre on remarque un décalage entre la proportion de ménages qui possèdent au moins une moustiquaire et celle de ménages qui ont au moins une moustiquaire imprégnée d'insecticides (MII) au moment de l'enquête (18 % contre 15 %). Le même décalage existe entre la proportion de ménages qui possèdent plus d'une moustiquaire et celle de ménages qui possèdent plus d'une MII au moment de l'enquête (6 % et4 %).  <br><br>Utilisation des moustiquaires. Seulement 16 % d'enfants de moins de cinq ans ont dormi sous une moustiquaire la nuit précédant l'enquête. Par ailleurs, 20 % de femmes enceintes ont dormi sous une moustiquaire au cours de la nuit ayant précédé l'interview. <br><br>MORTALITÉ DES ENFANTS <br><br>La mortalité des enfants reste élevée au plan national. Pour la période la plus récente (0-4 ans avant l'enquête), les résultats montrent que sur 1 000 naissances vivantes, 86 meurent avant d'atteindre leur premier anniversaire (37 ‰ entre 0 et 1 mois exact et 49 ‰ entre 1 et 12 mois exacts), et que sur 1 000 enfants âgés d'un an, 72 n'atteignent pas leur cinquième anniversaire. Globalement, le risque de décès entre la naissance et le cinquième anniversaire est de 152 pour 1 000 naissances. <br><br>Les résultats de l'EDSR-III indiquent une baisse significative des taux de mortalité infantile et infanto-juvénile par rapport à l'enquête de 2000. En outre, en comparant ces résultats avec ceux de l'enquête de 1992, on remarque que la mortalité infantile et la mortalité infanto-juvénile sont retournés au niveau où ils étaient lors de l'EDSR-I. <br><br>MORTALITÉ MATERNELLE <br><br>La mortalité maternelle est très élevée au Rwanda. Pour la période 0-4 ans avant l'enquête, le taux de mortalité maternelle est estimé à 750 décès pour 100 000 naissances vivantes. Ce taux a connu une baisse non négligeable par rapport à celui estimé lors de l'EDSR-II de 2000. Il se situait alors à 1 071 pour la période de 1995-1999. <br><br>VIOLENCE DOMESTIQUE <br><br>Près d'un tiers des femmes (31 %) a déclaré avoir subi des violences physiques à un moment quelconque depuis l'âge de 15 ans et, dans 19 % des cas, les femmes ont subi ces actes de violence au cours des douze derniers mois. Le plus fréquemment, l'auteur de ces violences est le mari ou partenaire. Quel que soit le type de violence considéré, physique ou sexuelle, les femmes souffrent souvent de conséquences graves : pendant les 12 derniers mois, dans 22 % des cas, les violences ont eu pour conséquences des hématomes ou des meurtrissures et même, dans 14 % des cas, des blessures ou des os cassés. Dans 7 % de ces cas, <br>les femmes ont dû aller chez un médecin ou dans un établissement sanitaire.  <br><br>CONNAISSANCE, ATTITUDES ET COMPORTEMENTS VIS-À-VIS DES IST/SIDA <br><br>La quasi-totalité des enquêtés ont déclaré connaître le VIH/sida, pourtant seulement 54 % des femmes et 58 % des hommes possédaient toutes les connaissances générales concernant le sida au moment de l'enquête.  <br><br>Le niveau de connaissance des moyens de prévention du VIH/sida reste encore insuffisant : 73 % des femmes et 80 % des hommes savent qu'on peut limiter les risques de contracter le sida en utilisant le condom et en limitant les rapports sexuels à un seul partenaire fidèle et non infecté. <br><br>Seulement 51 % des hommes et 46 % des femmes auraient un comportement de tolérance face à des personnes atteintes du VIH/sida, ce qui montre que le niveau de stigmatisation et de discrimination reste élevé au Rwanda.  <br><br>L'enquête montre aussi que 8 % des femmes et 14 % des hommes ont déclaré avoir eu des rapports sexuels à hauts risques, mais seulement 20 % de ces femmes et 41 % de ces hommes ont utilisé un condom lors des derniers rapports sexuels à hauts risques. <br><br>Parmi les femmes enceintes, seules 22 % ont affirmé à la fois avoir reçu des conseils sur le VIH/sida au cours de leurs visites prénatales, avoir été testées et avoir reçu les résultats de ce test. <br><br>Les résultats de l'enquête montrent aussi que parmi les jeunes de 15-24 ans, 51 % des femmes et 54 % des hommes sont considérés comme ayant une connaissance complète du VIH/sida et que 12 % des hommes et 7 % des femmes ont utilisé le condom au cours de leurs premiers rapports sexuels.  <br><br>PRÉVALENCE DU VIH <br><br>Taux de couverture du test de VIH. Dans l'ensemble, 97 % des enquêtés ciblés ont fournit les gouttes de sang pour le test du VIH. Le taux de couverture en milieu urbain est de 94 % et de 97 % en milieu rural.  <br>Prévalence du VIH. Les résultats de l'enquête ont montré que 3 % des adultes âgés de 15 à 49 ans sont infectés par le VIH. Le taux de prévalence chez les femmes est supérieur à celui chez les hommes du même groupe d'âge. Le ratio entre les femmes et les hommes est de 1,6. <br><br>Pour l'ensemble des femmes et des hommes, la prévalence du VIH en milieu urbain est significativement différente de celle en  milieu rural. Selon la région de résidence, la Ville de Kigali occupe la première place avec un taux de prévalence du VIH dans la population âgée de 15 à 49 ans égal à 6,7 %. Chez les jeunes âgés de 15 à 24 ans, la Ville de Kigali a une prévalence de 3,4 %. La prévalence du VIH la plus basse s'observe dans la province du Nord avec un taux de 2 %. <br><br>Selon les tranches d'âges, la prévalence du VIH atteint son maximum chez les hommes âgés de 40-44 ans (7,1 %) et chez les femmes âgées de 35-39 ans (6,9 %).  <br>VIH et facteurs associés. La prévalence du VIH est très élevée chez les personnes qui ont déclaré avoir eu une IST au cours des 12 derniers mois (15,7 %). La prévalence est également élevée chez les veuves (15,9 %) et les divorcées/séparées (10,9 %). <br><br>Les résultats de l'EDSR-III montrent que 56 % des hommes et 64 % des femmes qui étaient séropositifs au moment de l'enquête n'avaient jamais effectués de test du VIH antérieurement. <br><br>AIDE ET SUPPORT POUR LES PERSONNES VULNÉRABLES <br><br>Environ un enfant sur cinq de moins de 18 ans est orphelin de père et/ou de mère : 4 % ont perdu leurs deux parents, 13 % sont orphelins de père et 3 % ont perdu leur mère.  <br><br>En outre, 11 % des enfants sont considérés comme vulnérables. Globalement, 29 % des enfants de moins de 18 ans peuvent être considérés comme des enfants orphelins et vulnérables. C'est dans la Ville de Kigali que cette proportion est la plus élevée (35 %) et c'est dans le Nord qu'elle est la plus faible (25 %).  <br><br>Les résultats de l'enquête ont montré que l'état de survie des parents influence le niveau de fréquentation scolaire des enfants de 10-14 ans. En effet, quand les deux parents sont en vie et que les enfants vivent avec au moins un des deux parents, 91 % vont à l'école. Par contre, quand les deux parents sont décédés, cette proportion n'est plus que de 75 %.   <br><br>Au Rwanda, les orphelins et enfants vulnérables (OEV) ne souffrent pas plus fréquem­ment de malnutrition que les autres enfants, quelque soit l'âge et le sexe de l'enfant. Le ratio inférieur à 1 (0,92) traduit le fait que les non OEV sont proportionnellement légèrement plus atteints par la malnutrition que les OEV. <br><br>D'autre part, il semble que les rapports sexuels précoces soient légèrement plus fréquents parmi les OEV (6 % des filles et 15 % des garçons) que parmi les autres enfants (5 % des filles et 14 % des garçons). <br><br>Très peu de ménages rwandais ont reçu une aide pour s'occuper des personnes malades. Globalement, pour 12 % des personnes malades, les ménages ont reçu un support, que ce soit sur le plan médical, social ou matériel ou encore émotionnel. Dans moins d'un pour cent des cas, ils ont reçu toutes les formes d'aide. <br><br>Dans 87 % des cas, les ménages rwandais n'ont reçu aucune aide extérieure gratuite pour s'occuper des OEV. Quand un appui a été fourni, il s'est agi, dans 9 % des cas, d'une assistance pour l'école. Les autres types de support n'ont atteint qu'une faible proportion d'OEV.",0049599,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Rwanda - Demographic and Health Survey 2010,"The 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS) is designed to provide data for monitoring the population and health situation in Rwanda. The 2010 RDHS is the fifth Demographic and Health Survey to be conducted in Rwanda. The objective of the survey is to provide up-to-date information on fertility, family planning, childhood mortality, nutrition, maternal and child health, domestic violence, malaria, maternal mortality, awareness and behavior regarding HIV/AIDS, HIV prevalence, malaria prevalence, and anemia prevalence.

Rwanda - Rwanda Community Performance-Based Financing Impact Evaluation 2013,"Since June 2006, Rwanda has implemented a national supply-side performance-based financing (PBF) program in hospitals and health centers. This ‘first generation’ PBF program provided financial rewards to health facilities in order to promote maternal, child, and HIV/AIDS healthcare. A prospective, rigorous impact evaluation (IE) was developed with the commitment of the Government of Rwanda (GOR) to assess the impacts of PBF on health outcomes and determine the possibility of scaling-up the PBF initiative nationwide. The IE showed significant positive impacts on quality of prenatal care, as well as increased utilization of institutional delivery and child preventive care services. However, it highlighted the limited effect of the supply-side intervention on other services, such as the demand for timely prenatal care and family planning.<br><br>In 2010 the ‘second generation’ of PBF in Rwanda, the Community Performance-Based Financing (CPBF) program, was initiated to tackle the remaining issue of low utilization of health services by mothers and their children. The Community PBF implemented the following three interventions: (i) demand-side in-kind incentives for women, (ii) financial rewards for community health worker (CHW) cooperatives, and (iii) combined demand-side and CHW rewards. The three CPBF interventions were introduced in October 2010 in randomly selected sectors. <br><br>The CPBF program is evaluated by a prospective, randomized impact evaluation (IE). The IE evaluates the causal effect of the CPBF interventions on maternal and child health outputs and outcomes. This report presents analysis of the IE data that assessed the program impact by comparing outcomes in sectors implementing the three different interventions and a comparison group of sectors not implementing any of the interventions. The IE relies on baseline (Q1-Q2 2010) and follow up (Q4 2013-Q2 2014) data collection, consisting of household, CHW and CHW cooperative surveys. A health facility assessment was conducted at the follow up survey. <br><br>The endline survey for the impact evaluation was fielded from November 2013 to June 2014. The University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences School of Public Health (UR-CMHS-SPH) managed all activities related to data collection and entry. The baseline survey questionnaires were adapted to account for the modification to the sample described in the previous chapter. In addition, modules asking about the experience with the CPBF program have been added. Because the baseline survey did not include the health facility assessment, the relevant questionnaires were created by adapting the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) samples.  Apart from the health facility assessment that was conducted in French, all other interviews were conducted in Kinyarwanda. <br><br>The household questionnaire duration was approximately 120-150 minutes after having introduced the team and explained the purpose of their visit. Each field team was composed of 8 members and led by a team supervisor. All enumerators recruited were trained in biometric and anthropometric measurement. At the end of the interview, the interviewer would give caregivers feedback about the relevant health outcomes (e.g. anemia status, child nutrition status) of the children. In the event that study personnel identified children with serious health problems, the medical professional on the team provided the caregiver with information about where and how to seek medical care (usually at the closest medical center). The study team did not provide direct medical care to participants. There was no financial payment to participants enrolled in the study. However, each household received a contribution of 3,000 RWF for the community health insurance scheme (Mutuelle de santé) for one household member.<br><br>This dataset contains the data from the follow up household survey.  In each village from the baseline sample, the survey team was to re-interview the baseline women, interview the women with the most recent birth or pregnancy in the village. These women were defined as the ‘core respondents’ and their households were selected for the survey. 4,468 Households are included in the dataset, 2157 with baseline women and 2343 with a recent birth or pregnancy. Thirty-two households fall into both categories.<br><br>Because of the costs implied the large sample, the research team decided to narrow the scope of the household survey relative to that in the baseline. Some of the sections have been shortened. In addition, the survey is focused to greater extent on the core woman, defined as the woman who gave the birth that led to the selection of the household. The women questionnaire was only administered to these women (and not all women of ages 15-49 as in the baseline). The Child questionnaire only covered children of the core respondent, and not all children in the household.",0049583,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Philippines - National Demographic Survey 1993,"The 1993 National Demographic Survey (NDS) is a nationally representative sample survey of women age 15-49 designed to collect information on fertility; family planning; infant, child and maternal mortality; and maternal and child health. The survey was conducted between April and June 1993. The 1993 NDS was carried out by the National Statistics Office in collaboration with the Department of Health, the University of the Philippines Population Institute, and other agencies concerned with population, health and family planning issues. Funding for the 1993 NDS was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development through the Demographic and Health Surveys Program. <br><br>Close to 13,000 households throughout the country were visited during the survey and more than 15,000 women age 15-49 were interviewed. The results show that fertility in the Philippines continues its gradual decline. At current levels, Filipino women will give birth on average to 4.1 children during their reproductive years, 0.2 children less than that recorded in 1988. However, the total fertility rate in the Philippines remains high in comparison to the level achieved in the neighboring Southeast Asian countries. <br><br>The primary objective of the 1993 NDS is to provide up-to-date inform ation on fertility and mortality levels; nuptiality; fertility preferences; awareness, approval, and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; and maternal and child health. This information is intended to assist policymakers and administrators in evaluating and designing programs and strategies for improving health and family planning services in 'the country. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Fertility varies significantly by region and socioeconomic characteristics. Urban women have on average 1.3 children less than rural women, and uneducated women have one child more than women with college education. Women in Bicol have on average 3 more children than women living in Metropolitan Manila. <br><br>Virtually all women know of a family planning method; the pill, female sterilization, IUD and condom are known to over 90 percent of women. Four in 10 married women are currently using contraception. The most popular method is female sterilization ( 12 percent), followed by the piU (9 percent), and natural family planning and withdrawal, both used by 7 percent of married women. <br><br>Contraceptive use is highest in Northern Mindanao, Central Visayas and Southern Mindanao, in urban areas, and among women with higher than secondary education. The contraceptive prevalence rate in the Philippines is markedly lower than in the neighboring Southeast Asian countries; the percentage of married women who were using family planning in Thailand was 66 percent in 1987, and 50 percent in Indonesia in 199l. <br><br>The majority of contraceptive users obtain their methods from a public service provider (70 percent). Government health facilities mainly provide permanent methods, while barangay health stations or health centers are the main sources for the pill, IUD and condom. <br><br>Although Filipino women already marry at a relatively higher age, they continue to delay the age at which they first married. Half of Filipino women marry at age 21.6. Most women have their first sexual intercourse after marriage. <br><br>Half of married women say that they want no more children, and 12 percent have been sterilized. An additional 19 percent want to wait at least two years before having another child. Almost two thirds of women in the Philippines express a preference for having 3 or less children. Results from the survey indicate that if all unwanted births were avoided, the total fertility rate would be 2.9 children, which is almost 30 percent less than the observed rate, <br><br>More than one quarter of married women in the Philippines are not using any contraceptive method, but want to delay their next birth for two years or more (12 percent), or want to stop childbearing (14 percent). If the potential demand for family planning is satisfied, the contraceptive prevalence rate could increase to 69 percent. The demand for stopping childbearing is about twice the level for spacing (45 and 23 percent, respectively). <br><br>Information on various aspects of maternal and child health---antenatal care, vaccination, breastfeeding and food supplementation, and illness was collected in the 1993 NDS on births in the five years preceding the survey. The findings show that 8 in 10 children under five were bom to mothers who received antenatal care from either midwives or nurses (45 percent) or doctors (38 percent). Delivery by a medical personnel is received by more than half of children born in the five years preceding the survey. However, the majority of deliveries occurred at home. <br><br>Tetanus, a leading cause of infant deaths, can be prevented by immunization of the mother during pregnancy. In the Philippines, two thirds of bitlhs in the five years preceding the survey were to mothers who received a tetanus toxoid injection during pregnancy. <br><br>Based on reports of mothers and information obtained from health cards, 90 percent of children aged 12-23 months have received shots of the BCG as well as the first doses of DPT and polio, and 81 percent have received immunization from measles. Immunization coverage declines with doses; the drop out rate is 3 to 5 percent for children receiving the full dose series of DPT and polio. Overall, 7 in 10 children age 12-23 months have received immunization against the six principal childhood diseases---polio, diphtheria, ~rtussis, tetanus, measles and tuberculosis. <br><br>During the two weeks preceding the survey, 1 in 10 children under 5 had diarrhea. Four in ten of these children were not treated. Among those who were treated, 27 percent were given oral rehydration salts, 36 percent were given recommended home solution or increased fluids. <br><br>Breasffeeding is less common in the Philippines than in many other developing countries. Overall, a total of 13 percent of children born in the 5 years preceding the survey were not breastfed at all. On the other hand, bottle feeding, a widely discouraged practice, is relatively common in the Philippines. Children are weaned at an early age; one in four children age 2-3 months were exclusively breastfed, and the mean duration of breastfeeding is less than 3 months. <br><br>Infant and child mortality in the Philippines have declined significantly in the past two decades. For every 1,000 live births, 34 infants died before their first birthday. Childhood mortality varies significantly by mother's residence and education. The mortality of urban infants is about 40 percent lower than that of rural infants. The probability of dying among infants whose mother had no formal schooling is twice as high as infants whose mother have secondary or higher education. Children of mothers who are too young or too old when they give birth, have too many prior births, or give birth at short intervals have an elevated mortality risk. Mortality risk is highest for children born to mothers under age 19. <br><br>The 1993 NDS also collected information necessary for the calculation of adult and maternal mortality using the sisterhood method. For both males and females, at all ages, male mortality is higher than that of females. Matemal mortality ratio for the 1980-1986 is estimated at 213 per 100,000 births, and for the 1987-1993 period 209 per 100,000 births. However, due to the small number of sibling deaths reported in the survey, age-specific rates should be used with caution. <br><br>Information on health and family planning services available to the residents of the 1993 NDS barangay was collected from a group of respondents in each location. Distance and time to reach a family planning service provider has insignificant association with whether a woman uses contraception or the choice of contraception being used. On the other hand, being close to a hospital increases the likelihood that antenatal care and births are to respondents who receive ANC and are delivered by a medical personnel or delivered in a health facility.",0049496,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Philippines - National Demographic and Health Survey 1998,"The 1998 Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). is a nationally-representative survey of 13,983 women age 15-49. The NDHS was designed to provide information on levels and trends of fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality, and maternal and child health. It was implemented by the National Statistics Office in collaboration with the Department of Health (DOH). Macro International Inc. of Calverton, Maryland provided technical assistance to the project, while financial assistance was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the DOH. Fieldwork for the NDHS took place from early March to early May 1998. <br><br>The primary objective of the NDHS is to Provide up-to-date information on fertility levels; determinants of fertility; fertility preferences; infant and childhood mortality levels; awareness, approval, and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; and maternal and child health. This information is intended to assist policy makers and program managers in evaluating and designing programs and strategies for improving health and family planning services in the country. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Survey data generally confirm patterns observed in the 1993 National Demographic Survey (NDS), showing increasing contraceptive use and declining fertility. <br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Decline. The NDHS data indicate that fertility continues to decline gradually but steadily. At current levels, women will give birth an average of 3.7 children per woman during their reproductive years, a decline from the level of 4.1 recorded in the 1993 NDS. A total fertility rate of 3.7, however, is still considerably higher than the rates prevailing in neighboring Southeast Asian countries. <br><br>Fertility Differentials. Survey data show that the large differential between urban and rural fertility levels is widening even further. While the total fertility rate in urban areas declined by about 15 percent over the last five years (from 3.5 to 3.0), the rate among rural women barely declined at all (from 4.8 to 4.7). Consequently, rural women give birth to almost two children more than urban women. <br><br>Significant differences in fertility levels by region still exist. For example, fertility is more than twice as high in Eastern Visayas and Bicol Regions (with total fertility rates well over 5 births per woman) than in Metro Manila (with a rate of 2.5 births per woman). <br><br>Fertility levels are closely related to women's education. Women with no formal education give birth to an average of 5.0 children in their lifetime, compared to 2.9 for women with at least some college education. Women with either elementary or high school education have intermediate fertility rates. <br><br>Family Size Norms. One reason that fertility has not fallen more rapidly is that women in the Philippines still want moderately large families. Only one-third of women say they would ideally like to have one or two children, while another third state a desire for three children. The remaining third say they would choose four or more children. Overall, the mean ideal family size among all women is 3.2 children, identical to the mean found in 1993. <br><br>Unplanned Fertility. Another reason for the relatively high fertility level is that unplanned pregnancies are still common in the Philippines. Overall, 45 percent of births in the five years prior to the survey were reported to be unplanned; 27 percent were mistimed (wanted later) and 18 percent were unwanted. If unwanted births could be eliminated altogether, the total fertility rate in the Philippines would be 2.7 births per woman instead of the actual level of 3.7. <br><br>Age at First Birth. Fertility rates would be even higher if Filipino women did not have a pattem of late childbearing. The median age at first birth is 23 years in the Philippines, considerably higher than in most other countries. Another factor that holds down the overall level of fertility is the fact that about 9 or 10 percent of women never give birth, higher than the level of 3-4 percent found in most developing countries. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Increasing Use of Contraception. A major cause of declining fertility in the Philippines has been the gradual but fairly steady increase in contraceptive use over the last three decades. The contraceptive prevalence rate has tripled since 1968, from 15 to 47 percent of married women. Although contraceptive use has increased since the 1993 NDS (from 40 to 47 percent of married women), comparison with the series of nationally representative Family Planning Surveys indicates that there has been a levelling-off in family planning use in recent years. <br><br>Method Mix. Use of traditional methods of family planning has always accounted for a relatively high proportion of overall use in the Philippines, and data from the 1998 NDHS show the proportion holding steady at about 40 percent. The dominant changes in the ""method mix"" since 1993 have been an increase in use of injectables and traditional methods such as calendar rhythm and withdrawal and a decline in the proportions using female sterilization. Despite the decline in the latter, female sterilization still is the most widely used method, followed by the pill. <br><br>Differentials in Family Planning Use. Differentials in current use of family planning in the 16 administrative regions of the country are large, ranging from 16 percent of married women in ARMM to 55 percent of those in Southern Mindanao and Central Luzon. Contraceptive use varies considerably by education of women. Only 15 percent of married women with no formal education are using a method, compared to half of those with some secondary school. The urban-rural gap in contraceptive use is moderate (51 vs. 42 percent, respectively). <br><br>Knowledge of Contraception. Knowledge of contraceptive methods and supply sources has been almost universal in the Philippines for some time and the NDHS results indicate that 99 percent of currently married women age 15-49 have heard of at least one method of family planning. More than 9 in 10 married women know the pill, IUD, condom, and female sterilization, while about 8 in 10 have heard of injectables, male sterilization, rhythm, and withdrawal. Knowledge of injectables has increased far more than any other method, from 54 percent of married women in 1993 to 89 percent in 1998. <br><br>Unmet Need for Family Planning. Unmet need for family planning services has declined since I993. Data from the 1993 NDS show that 26 percent of currently married women were in need of services, compared with 20 percent in the 1998 NDHS. A little under half of the unmet need is comprised of women who want to space their next birth, while just over half is for women who do not want any more children (limiters). If all women who say they want to space or limit their children were to use methods, the contraceptive prevalence rate could be increased from 47 percent to 70 percent of married women. Currently, about three-quarters of this ""total demand"" for family planning is being met. <br><br>Discontinuation Rates. One challenge for the family planning program is to reduce the high levels of contraceptive discontinuation. NDHS data indicate that about 40 percent of contraceptive users in the Philippines stop using within 12 months of starting, almost one-third of whom stop because of an unwanted pregnancy (i.e., contraceptive failure). Discontinuation rates vary by method. Not surprisingly, the rates for the condom (60 percent), withdrawal (46 percent), and the pill (44 percent) are considerably higher than for the 1UD (14 percent). However, discontinuation rates for injectables are relatively high, considering that one dose is usually effective for three months. Fifty-two percent of injection users discontinue within one year of starting, a rate that is higher than for the pill. <br><br>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Childhood Mortality. Survey results show that although the infant mortality rate remains unchanged, overall mortality of children under five has declined somewhat in recent years. Under-five mortality declined from 54 deaths per 1,000 births in 1988-92 to 48 for the period 1993-97. The infant mortality rate remained stable at about 35 per 1,000 births. <br>Childhood Vaccination Coverage. The 1998 NDHS results show that 73 percent of children 12- 23 months are fully vaccinated by the date of the interview, almost identical to the level of 72 percent recorded in the 1993 NDS. When the data are restricted to vaccines received before the child's first birthday, however, only 65 percent of children age 12-23 months can be considered to be fully vaccinated. <br><br>Childhood Health. The NDHS provides some data on childhood illness and treatment. Approximately one in four children under age five had a fever and 13 percent had respiratory illness in the two weeks before the survey. Of these, 58 percent were taken to a health facility for treatment. Seven percent of children under five were reported to have had diarrhea in the two weeks preceeding the survey. The fact that four-fifths of children with diarrhea received some type of oral rehydration therapy (fluid made from an ORS packet, recommended homemade fluid, or increased fluids) is encouraging. <br><br>Breastfeeding Practices. Almost all Filipino babies (88 percent) are breastfed for some time, with a median duration of breastfeeding of 13 months. Although breastfeeding has beneficial effects on both the child and the mother, NDHS data indicate that supplementation of breastfeeding with other liquids and foods occurs too early in the Philippines. For example, among newborns less than two months of age, 19 percent were already receiving supplemental foods or liquids other than water. <br><br>Maternal Health Care. NDHS data point to several areas regarding maternal health care in which improvements could be made. Although most Filipino mothers (86 percent) receive prenatal care from a doctor, nurse, or midwife, tetanus toxoid coverage is far from universal and has been declining somewhat. The proportion of recent births for which the mother reported receiving two or more tetanus toxoid vaccinations during pregnancy declined from 42 in 1993 to 38 percent. Moreover, two-thirds of births in the Philippines are delivered at home; consequently only 56 percent receive asistance at delivery from a doctor, nurse, or midwife and 41 percent are assisted by traditional birth attendants. Proper medical attention during pregnancy and hygienic conditions during delivery can reduce the risk of complications and infections that can cause death or serious illness for either the mother or the newborn. Somewhat more encouraging is the fact that for 75 percent of recent births, mothers reported having received iron tablets during pregnancy and in 57 percent of cases, they received iodine tablets during pregnancy. Maternal mortality has remained low at approximately 200 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. <br><br>HOUSEHOLD HEALTH ISSUES <br><br>Health Care Financing. NDHS data indicate that in 40 percent of households, at least one member of the household belongs to a health care financing scheme or an insurance plan. Over 90 percent of such households belong to Medicare. <br><br>Knowledge of Herbal Medieines. The Deparmnent of Health has endorsed 10 herbal medicines as being scientifically proven effective for treatment of specific illnesses and conditions. NDHS data show that although awareness of some of these herbs is widespread, knowledge about the specific uses of the herbs is quite limited. For example, although 81 percent of household respondents recognized ampalaya,only one in 20 know that it is useful in treating diabetes and only 6 percent of the 75 percent of respondents who are familiar with sambongcorrectly said that it is used as a diuretic. However, knowledge of bayabasis high; 97 percent of household respondents had heard of it and 81 percent know that it is used to clean wounds. <br><br>Knowledge of Healthy Lifestyle. NDHS data indicate quite high general awareness regarding health issues. For example, most household respondents say that they watch their nutrition or exercise to stay healthy. Similarly, a majority of household respondents are aware that smoking causes lung diseases such as cancer. Over 90 percent of respondents have heard of dengue fever and two-thirds of them say that dengue can be prevented by destroying the breeding sites of mosquitos. However, misconceptions about leprosy and tuberculosis abound, with 21 percent of respondents knowing that leprosy is transmitted by skin and 11 percent by airborne droplets, and only one in six respondents knowing that tuberculosis is caused by a germ or bacteria.",0049494,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Beam, David McKenzie, Dean Yang. According to the study, signifcant income gains from migrating from poorer to richer countries have motivated unilateral (source-country) policies facilitating labor emigration. However, their effectiveness is unknown. The investigators conducted a large-scale randomized experiment in the Philippines testing the impact of unilaterally facilitating international labor migration. Their most intensive treatment doubled the rate of job offers but had no identifable effect on international labor migration. Even the highest overseas job-search rate they induced (22%) falls far short of the share initially expressing interest in migrating (34%).

"Peru - WSP Global Scaling up Handwashing Behavior Impact Evaluation, Baseline and Endline Surveys 2009-2011","In Peru, the handwashing project targets mothers/caregivers of children under five years old, and it is aimed at improving handwashing with soap practices. Children under five represent the age group most susceptible to diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infections, which are two major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in less developed countries.<br><br>These infections, usually transferred from dirty hands to food or water sources, or by direct contact with the mouth, can be prevented if mothers/caregivers wash their hands with soap at critical times (such as before feeding a child, cooking, eating, and after using a toilet or changing a child’s diapers). In an effort to improve handwashing behavior, the intervention borrows from both commercial and social marketing fields. This entails the design of communications campaigns and messages likely to bring about the desired behavior changes, and delivering them strategically so that the target audiences are “surrounded” by handwashing promotion. <br><br>Some key elements of the intervention include:<br>• Key behavioral concepts or triggers for each target audience<br>• Persuasive arguments stating why and how a given concept or trigger will lead to behavior change, and<br>• Communication ideas to convey the concepts through many integrated activities and communication channels.<br><br>The objective of the IE is to assess the effects of the project on individual-level handwashing behavior and practices of caregivers and children. By introducing exogenous variation in handwashing promotion (through randomized exposure to the project), the IE also addresses important issues related to the effect of intended behavioral change on child health and development outcomes. In particular, it provides information on the extent to which improved handwashing behavior impacts infant health and welfare.",0049456,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

The survey was carried out by the National Institute of Population Studies with the objective of assisting the Ministry of Population Welfare to evaluate the Population Welfare Programme and maternal and child health services. The PDHS is the latest in a series of surveys, making it possible to evaluate changes in the demographic status of the population and in health conditions nationwide. Earlier surveys include the Pakistan Contraceptive Prevalence Survey of 1984-85 and the Pakistan Fertility Survey of 1975. <br><br>The primary objective of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) was to provide national- and provincial-level data on population and health in Pakistan. The primary emphasis was on the following topics: fertility, nuptiality, family size preferences, knowledge and use of family planning, the potential demand for contraception, the level of unwanted fertility, infant and child mortality, breastfeeding and food supplementation practices, maternal care, child nutrition and health, immunisations and child morbidity. This information is intended to assist policy makers, administrators and researchers in assessing and evaluating population and health programmes and strategies. The PDHS is further intended to serve as a source of demographic data for comparison with earlier surveys, particularly the 1975 Pakistan Fertility Survey (PFS) and the 1984-85 Pakistan Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (PCPS). <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Until recently, fertility rates had remained high with little evidence of any sustained fertility decline. In recent years, however, fertility has begun to decline due to a rapid increase in the age at marriage and to a modest rise in the prevalence of contraceptive use. The lotal fertility rate is estimated to have fallen from a level of approximately 6.4 children in the early 1980s to 6.0 children in the mid-1980s, to 5.4 children in the late 1980s. The exact magnitude of the change is in dispute and will be the subject of further research. Important differentials of fertility include the degree ofurbanisation and the level of women's education. The total fertility rate is estimated to be nearly one child lower in major cities (4.7) than in rural areas (5.6). Women with at least some secondary schooling have a rate of 3.6, compared to a rate of 5.7 children for women with no formal education. <br><br>There is a wide disparity between women's knowledge and use of contraceptives in Pakistan. While 78 percent of currently married women report knowing at least one method of contraception, only 21 percent have ever used a method, and only 12 percent are currently doing so. Three-fourths of current users are using a modem method and one-fourth a traditional method. The two most commonly used methods are female sterilisation (4 percent) and the condom (3 percent). Despite the relatively low level of contraceptive use, the gain over time has been significant. Among married non-pregnant women, contraceptive use has almost tripled in 15 years, from 5 percent in 1975 to 14 percent in 1990-91. The contraceptive prevalence among women with secondary education is 38 percent, and among women with no schooling it is only 8 percent. Nearly one-third of women in major cities arc current users of contraception, but contraceptive use is still rare in rural areas (6 percent). <br><br>The Government of Pakistan plays a major role in providing family planning services. Eighty-five percent of sterilised women and 81 percent of IUD users obtained services from the public sector. Condoms, however, were supplied primarily through the social marketing programme. <br><br>The use of contraceptives depends on many factors, including the degree of acceptability of the concept of family planning. Among currently married women who know of a contraceptive method, 62 percent approve of family planning. There appears to be a considerable amount of consensus between husbands and wives about family planning use: one-third of female respondents reported that both they and their husbands approve of family planning, while slightly more than one-fifth said they both disapprove. The latter couples constitute a group for which family planning acceptance will require concerted motivational efforts.<br> <br>The educational levels attained by Pakistani women remain low: 79 percent of women have had no formal education, 14 percent have studied at the primary or middle school level, and only 7 percent have attended at least some secondary schooling. The traditional social structure of Pakistan supports a natural fertility pattern in which the majority of women do not use any means of fertility regulation. In such populations, the proximate determinants of fertility (other than contraception) are crucial in determining fertility levels. These include age at marriage, breastfeeding, and the duration of postpartum amenorrhoea and abstinence. <br><br>The mean age at marriage has risen sharply over the past few decades, from under 17 years in the 1950s to 21.7 years in 1991. Despite this rise, marriage remains virtually universal: among women over the age of 35, only 2 percent have never married. Marriage patterns in Pakistan are characterised by an unusually high degree of consangninity. Half of all women are married to their first cousin and an additional 11 percent are married to their second cousin. <br><br>Breasffeeding is important because of the natural immune protection it provides to babies, and the protection against pregnancy it gives to mothers. Women in Pakistan breastfeed their children for an average of20months. Themeandurationofpostpartumamenorrhoeais slightly more than 9 months. After tbebirth of a child, women abstain from sexual relations for an average of 5 months. As a result, the mean duration of postpartum insusceptibility (the period immediately following a birth during which the mother is protected from the risk of pregnancy) is 11 months, and the median is 8 months. Because of differentials in the duration of breastfeeding and abstinence, the median duration of insusceptibility varies widely: from 4 months for women with at least some secondary education to 9 months for women with no schooling; and from 5 months for women residing in major cities to 9 months for women in rural areas. <br><br>In the PDHS, women were asked about their desire for additional sons and daughters. Overall, 40 percent of currently married women do not want to have any more children. This figure increases rapidly depending on the number of children a woman has: from 17 percent for women with two living children, to 52 percent for women with four children, to 71 percent for women with six children. The desire to stop childbearing varies widely across cultural groupings. For example, among women with four living children, the percentage who want no more varies from 47 percent for women with no education to 84 percent for those with at least some secondary education. <br><br>Gender preference continues to be widespread in Pakistan. Among currently married non-pregnant women who want another child, 49 percent would prefer to have a boy and only 5 percent would prefer a girl, while 46 percent say it would make no difference. <br><br>The need for family planning services, as measured in the PDHS, takes into account women's statements concerning recent and future intended childbearing and their use of contraceptives. It is estimated that 25 percent of currently married women have a need for family planning to stop childbearing and an additional 12 percent are in need of family planning for spacing children. Thus, the total need for family planning equals 37 percent, while only 12 percent of women are currently using contraception. The result is an unmet need for family planning services consisting of 25 percent of currently married women. This gap presents both an opportunity and a challenge to the Population Welfare Programme. <br><br>Nearly one-tenth of children in Pakistan die before reaching their first birthday. The infant mortality rate during the six years preceding the survey is estimaled to be 91 per thousand live births; the under-five mortality rate is 117 per thousand. The under-five mortality rates vary from 92 per thousand for major cities to 132 for rural areas; and from 50 per thousand for women with at least some secondary education to 128 for those with no education. <br><br>The level of infant mortality is influenced by biological factors such as mother's age at birth, birth order and, most importantly, the length of the preceding birth interval. Children born less than two years after their next oldest sibling are subject to an infant mortality rate of 133 per thousand, compared to 65 for those spaced two to three years apart, and 30 for those born at least four years after their older brother or sister. <br><br>One of the priorities of the Government of Pakistan is to provide medical care during pregnancy and at the time of delivery, both of which are essential for infant and child survival and safe motherhood. Looking at children born in the five years preceding the survey, antenatal care was received during pregnancy for only 30 percent of these births. In rural areas, only 17 percent of births benefited from antenatal care, compared to 71 percent in major cities. Educational differentials in antenatal care are also striking: 22 percent of births of mothers with no education received antenatal care, compared to 85 percent of births of mothers with at least some secondary education. <br><br>Tetanus, a major cause of neonatal death in Pakistan, can be prevented by immunisation of the mother during pregnancy. For 30 percent of all births in the five years prior to the survey, the mother received a tetanus toxoid vaccination. The differentials are about the same as those for antenatal care generally. <br><br>Eighty-five percent of the births occurring during the five years preceding the survey were delivered at home. Sixty-nine percent of all births were attended by traditional or trained birth attendants, while 19 percent were assisted by a doctor or nurse. <br><br>The Expanded Programme on Immunisatlon in Pakistan has met with considerable success. Among children 12 to 23 months of age, 70 percent had received a BCG vaccination, 50 percent a measles vacci- nation, and 43 percent had received all three doses of DPT and polio vaccine. Only 35 percent, however, had received all of the recommended vaccinations, while 28 percent had received none at all. Thirty-nine percent of boys were fully protected, compared to 31 percent of girls. <br><br>Sixteen percent of children under the age of five had been ill with a cough accompanied by rapid breathing during the two weeks preceding the survey. Children 6-11 months old were most prone to acute respiratory infections (23 percent). Two-thirds (66 percent) of children who were sick were taken to a health facility or provider. All but 15 percent of the sick children received some kind of treatment. <br><br>About the same proportion of children (15 percent) had suffered from diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, with the highest incidence among children under two years of age. Nearly half (48 percent) were taken to a health facility or provider. About two of five (39 percent) children with diarrhoea were treated with oral rehydration solution prepared from ORS packets. Knowledge of oral rehydration therapy is widespread: 90 percent of mothers recognise ORS packets. Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of mothers have used ORS packets at some time, and among these, three-quarters had mixed the solution correctly the last time they prepared it. <br><br>Thirty percent of children had suffered from fever in the two weeks preceding the survey. Those most prone to illness were age 6 to 11 months. Two-thirds of children with fever were taken to a health facility or provider. <br><br>Inadequate nutrition continues to be a serious problem in Pakistan. Fifty percent of children under five years of age suffer from stunting (an indicator of chronic undemutrition), as measured by height for age. The prevalence of stunting increases with age, from 16 percent for children under 6 months to 63 percent of four-year olds. The lowest prevalence is found in Punjab (44 percent), and the highest in Balochistan (71 percent). The mother's level of education is an important factor; the prevalence of stunting varies from 18 percent for mothers with some secondary education to 56 percent for mothers with no education. <br><br>Acute undemutrition, low weight for height, is less of a problem in Pakistan than chronic undemutrition. Nine percent of children suffer from acute undemutrition (wasting). The prevalence of wasting does not vary substantially between geographic groupings. The largest differential is for mother's education: 4 percent of children of mothers with some secondary school or higher education are wasted, compared to 10 percent of children of mothers with no schooling.<br> <br>A systematic subsample of households in the women's survey was selected to obtain information from the husbands of currently married women. The focus was on obtaining information about attitudes, behaviour, and the role of husbands regarding family planning. Husbands' responses concerning knowledge and use of contraception were remarkably similar to women's responses: about four-fifths knew of at least one method, two-thirds knew of a source of supply, one-fourth reported that they and their spouses had used contraception sometime in the past, and about one-seventh were current users. <br><br>Although a majority of husbands (56 percent) approve of family planning, wives are more likely to favour family planning than their husbands. Since husbands usually have a predominant role in family decision making, the family planning programme should increase efforts to educate and motivate husbands.",0049394,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Pakistan - Demographic and Health Survey 2006-2007,"The 2006-07 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) was undertaken to address the monitoring and evaluation needs of maternal and child health and family planning programmes. The survey was designed with the broad objective to provide policymakers, primarily in the Ministries of Population Welfare and Health, with information to improve programmatic interventions based on empirical evidence. The aim is to provide reliable estimates of the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) at the national level and a variety of other health and population indicators at national, urban-rural, and provincial levels.<br><br>The 2006-07 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) is the fifth in a series of demographic surveys conducted by the National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) since 1990. However, the PDHS 2006-07 is the second survey conducted as part of the worldwide Demographic andHealth Surveys programme. The survey was conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Population Welfare and implemented by the National Institute of Population Studies. Other collaborating institutions include the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the Aga Khan University, and the National Committee for Maternal and Neonatal Health. Technical support was provided by Macro International Inc. and financial support was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) provided logistical support for monitoring the fieldwork for the PDHS.<br><br>The 2006-07 PDHS supplements and complements the information collected through the censuses and demographic surveys conducted by the Federal Bureau of Statistics. It updates the available information on population and health issues, and provides guidance in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating health and population programmes in Pakistan. Some of the findings of the PDHS may seem at variance with data compiled by other sources. This may be due to differences in methodology, reference period, wording of questions and subsequent interpretation. This fact may be kept in mind while analyzing and comparing PDHS data with other sources. The results of the survey assist in the monitoring of the progress made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).<br><br>The 2006-07 PDHS includes topics related to fertility levels and determinants, family planning, fertility preferences, infant, child and maternal mortality and their causes, maternal and child health, immunization and nutritional status of mothers and children, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, and malaria. The 2006-07 PDHS also includes direct estimation of maternal mortality and its causes at the national level for the first time in Pakistan.

Nigeria - Demographic and Health Survey 1990,"The 1990 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) is a nationally representative survey conducted by the Federal Office of Statistics with the aim of gathering reliable information on fertility, family planning, infant and child mortality, maternal care, vaccination status, breastfeeding, and nutrition. Data collection took place two years after implementation of the National Policy on Population and addresses issues raised by that policy. <br><br>Fieldwork for the NDHS was conducted in two phases: from April to July 1990 in the southern states and from July to October 1990 in the northern states. Interviewers collected information on the reproductive histories of 8,781 women age 15-49 years and on the health of their 8,113 children under the age of five years. <br><br>OBJECTIVES <br><br>The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) is a national sample survey of women of reproductive age designed to collect data on socioeconomic characteristics, marriage patterns, history of child bearing, breastfeeding, use of contraception, immunisation of children, accessibility to health and family planning services, treatment of children during episodes of illness, and the nutritional status of children. <br><br>The primary objectives of the NDHS are: <br><br>(i) To collect data for the evaluation of family planning and health programmes; <br>(ii) To assess the demographic situation in Nigeria; and <br>(iii) To support dissemination and utilisation of the results in planning and managing family planning and health programmes. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>According to the NDHS, fertility remains high in Nigeria; at current fertility levels, Nigerian women will have an average of 6 children by the end of their reproductive years. The total fertility rate may actually be higher than 6.0, due to underestimation of births. In a 1981/82 survey, the total fertility rate was estimated to be 5.9 children per woman. <br><br>One reason for the high level of fertility is that use of contraception is limited. Only 6 percent of married women currently use a contraceptive method (3.5 percent use a modem method, and 2.5 percent use a traditional method). These levels, while low, reflect an increase over the past decade: ten years ago just 1 percent of Nigerian women were using a modem family planning method. Periodic abstinence (rhythm method), the pill, IUD, and injection are the most popular methods among married couples: each is used by about 1 percent of currently married women. Knowledge of contraception remains low, with less than half of all women age 15-49 knowing of any method. <br><br>Certain groups of women are far more likely to use contraception than others. For example, urban women are four times more likely to be using a contraceptive method (15 percent) than rural women (4 percent). Women in the Southwest, those with more education, and those with five or more children are also more likely to be using contraception. <br><br>Levels of fertility and contraceptive use are not likely to change until there is a drop in desired family size and until the idea of reproductive choice is more widely accepted. At present, the average ideal family size is essentially the same as the total fertility rate: six children per woman. Thus, the vast majority of births are wanted. The desire for childbearing is strong: half of women with five children say that they want to have another child. <br><br>Another factor leading to high fertility is the early age at marriage and childbearing in Nigeria. Half of all women are married by age 17 and half have become mothers by age 20. More than a quarter of teenagers (women age 15-19 years) either are pregnant or already have children. <br><br>National statistics mask dramatic variations in fertility and family planning between urban and rural areas, among different regions of the country, and by women's educational attainment. Women who are from urban areas or live in the South and those who are better educated want and have fewer children than other women and are more likely to know of and use modem contraception. For example, women in the South are likely to marry and begin childbearing several years later than women in the North. In the North, women continue to follow the traditional pattern and marry early, at a median age of 15, while in the South, women are marrying at a median age of 19 or 20. Teenagers in the North have births at twice the rate of those in the South: 20 births per 1130 women age 15-19 in the North compared to 10 birdas per 100 women in the South. Nearly half of teens in the North have already begun childbearing, versus 14 percent in South. This results in substantially lower total fertility rates in the South: women in the South have, on average, one child less than women in the North (5.5 versus 6.6). <br><br>The survey also provides information related to maternal and child health. The data indicate that nearly 1 in 5 children dies before their fifth birthday. Of every 1,000 babies born, 87 die during their first year of life (infant mortality rate). There has been little improvement in infant and child mortality during the past 15 years. Mortality is higher in rural than urban areas and higher in the North than in the South. Undemutrition may be a factor contributing to childhood mortality levels: NDHS data show that 43 percent of the children under five are chronically undemourished. These problems are more severe in rural areas and in the North.<br> <br>Preventive and curative health services have yet to reach many women and children. Mothers receive no antenatal care for one-third of births and over 60 percent of all babies arc born at home. Only one-third of births are assisted by doctors, trained nurses or midwives. A third of the infants are never vaccinated, and only 30 percent are fully immunised against childhood diseases. When they are ill, most young children go untreated. For example, only about one-third of children with diarrhoea were given oral rehydration therapy. <br><br>Women and children living in rural areas and in the North are much less likely than others to benefit from health services. Almost four times as many births in the North are unassisted as in the South, and only one-third as many children complete their polio and DPT vaccinations. Programmes to educate women about the need for antenatal care, immunisation, and proper treatment for sick children should perhaps be aimed at mothers in these areas, <br><br>Mothers everywhere need to learn about the proper time to introduce various supplementary foods to breastfeeding babies. Nearly all babies are breastfed, however, almost all breastfeeding infants are given water, formula, or other supplements within the first two months of life, which both jeopardises their nutritional status and increases the risk of infection.",0049351,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Nigeria - Demographic and Health Survey 1999,"The 1999 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 8,199 women age 15-49 and 3,082 men age 15-64, designed to provide information on levels and trends of fetility, family planning practice, maternal and child health, infant and child mortality, and maternal mortality, as well as awareness of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and female circumcision. Fieldwork for the survey took place between March and May 1999. <br><br>OBJECTIVES<br><br>The main objective of the 1999 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) is to provide up-to-date information on reality and childhood mortality levels; nuptiality; fertility preferences; awareness, approval, and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; nutrition levels; and maternal and child health. This information is intended to assist policymakers and administrators in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving health and family planning services in Nigeria. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Fertility <br><br>The total fertility rate during the five years before the survey is 5.2 births per woman. This shows a drop from the level of 6.0 births per woman as reported in the 1990 NDHS and 5.4 from the 1994 Sentinel Survey. The total fertility rate may, however be higher due to evidence that some births were probably omitted in the data. Fertility is substantially higher in the Northeast and Northwest regions and lower in the Southeast, Southwest, and Central regions. Fertility rates are also lower for more educated women. <br><br>Childbearing begins early in Nigeria, with about half of women 25 years and above becoming mothers before reaching the age of 20. The median age at first birth is 20. <br><br>The level of teenage childbearing has declined somewhat, with the proportion of girls age 15-19 who have either given birth or are pregnant with their first child declining from 28 percent in 1990 to 22 percent in 1999. <br><br>Teenage childbearing is higher in rural than urban areas and for those with no education than those with education. <br><br>The data from the survey indicate that there is a strong desire for children and a preference for large families with 66 percent of married women and 71 percent of married men indicating a desire to have more children. Even among those with six or more children, 30 percent of married women and 55 percent of married men want to have more children. This indicates a decline for women from the 35 percent reported in the 1990 NDHS. Overall, women report a mean ideal number of children of 6.2, compared with 7.8 children for men. <br><br>Despite the increasing level of contraceptive use, the 1999 NDHS data show that unplanned pregnancies are common, with almost one in five births reported to be unplanned. Most of these (16 percent of births) are mistimed (wanted later), while 3 percent were unwanted at all. <br><br>Family Planning <br><br>Knowledge about family planning methods is increasing in Nigeria, with about 65 percent of all women and 82 percent of all men having heard of at least one method of contraception. <br><br>Among women, the pill is the best known method (53 percent) while among men, the condom is the best known method (70 percent). Radio is a main source of information about family planning, with 35 percent of women and 61 percent of men reporting that they heard a family planning message on the radio in the few months before interview. The proportions of women and men who have seen a television message are 23 and 40 percent, respectively. Only 17 percent of women had seen a family planning message in the print media. <br><br>The contraceptive prevalence rate in Nigeria has also increased, with 15 percent of married women and 32 percent of married men now using some method of family planning. The use of modem methods is lower at 9 percent for married women and 14 percent for men. Although traditional contraceptive methods are not actively promoted, their use is relatively high with about 6 percent of married women and 17 percent of married men reporting that they are using periodic abstinence or withdrawal. In 1990, only 6 percent of married women were using any method, with only 4 percent using a modern method. <br><br>There are significant differentials in levels of family planning use. Urban women and men are much more likely to be using a method than rural respondents. Current use among married women is higher in the Southwest regions (26 percent), Southeast (24 percent), and Central (18 percent) regions than in the Northwest and Northeast (3 percent each). The largest differences occur by educational attainment. Only 6 percent of married women with no education are using a method of contraception, compared with 45 percent of those with more than secondary school. <br><br>Users of modern contraception are almost as likely to obtain their methods from government as private sources. Forty-three percent of users obtain their methods from the public sector--mostly government hospitals and health centres--while 43 percent use private medical sources such as pharmacies and private hospitals and clinics; 8 percent get their methods from other private sources like friends, relatives, shops and non-governmental organisations. <br><br>Maternal Health <br><br>The results of the survey show that antenatal care is not uncommon in Nigeria, with mothers receiving antenatal check-ups from either a doctor, nurse or midwife for two out of three births in the three years preceding the survey. However, the content of antenatal care visits appears to be lacking in at least one respect: survey data indicate deficiencies in tetanus toxoid coverage during pregnancy. Mothers reported receiving the recommended two doses of tetanus toxoid for only 44 percent of births and one dose for I 1 percent of births. Almost 40 percent of births occurred without the benefit of a tetanus vaccination. <br><br>In Nigeria, home deliveries are still very common, with almost three in five births delivered at home. Compared with 1990, the proportion of home deliveries has declined, with more births now taking place in health facilities. Increasing the proportion of births occurring in facilities is important since they can be attended by medically trained personnel which can result in fewer maternal deaths and delivery complications. Currently, 42 percent of births are attended by doctors, nurses or midwives. <br><br>The 1999 NDHS data show that about one in four Nigerian women age 15-49 reported being circumcised. The practice of female genital cutting is more prevalent in the south and central parts of the country and is almost non-existent in the north. <br><br>Child Health <br><br>The 1999 NDHS data indicate a decline in childhood vaccination coverage, with the proportion of children fully immunised dropping from 30 percent of children age 12-23 months in 1990 to only 17 percent in 1999. Only a little over half of young children receive the BCG vaccine and the first doses of DPT and polio vaccines. Almost 40 percent of children have not received any vaccination. <br><br>Diarrhoea and respiratory illness are common causes of childhood death. In the two weeks before the survey, 11 percent of children under three years of age were ill with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and 15 percent had diarrhoea. Half of children with ARI and 37,percent of those with diarrhoea were taken to a health facility for treatment. Of all the children with diarrhoea, 34 percent were given fluid prepared from packets of oral rehydralion salts (ORS) and 38 percent received a home-made sugar-salt solution. <br><br>The infant mortality rate for the five-year period before the survey (early 1994 to early 1999) is 75 per thousand live births. The under-five mortality is 140 deaths per 1,000 births, which means that one in seven children born in Nigeria dies before reaching his/her fifth birthday. However, both these figures are probably considerably higher in reality since an in-depth examination of the data from the birth histories reported by women in the NDHS shows evidence of omission of births and deaths. For this reason, the dramatic decline observed in childhood mortality between the 1990 and 1999 NDHS surveys needs to be viewed with considerably skepticism. Based on the reported birth history information, the infant mortality rate fell from 87 to 75 deaths per 1,000 births, while the under-five mortality rate dropped from 192 to 140. <br><br>Problems with the overall levels of reported mortality are unlikely to severely affect differentials in childhood mortality. As expected, mother's level of education has a major effect on infant and child mortality. Whereas the lowest infant mortality rate was reported among children of mothers with post- secondary education (41 per thousand live births), the corresponding figure among infants of mothers with no schooling is 77 per thousand live births. <br><br>Data were also collected in the NDHS on the availability of various health services. The data indicate that the vast majority of Nigerian households live within five kilometres of a health facility, with health centres being the closest, followed by clinics and hospitals. <br><br>Breasffeeding and Nutrition <br><br>Breastfeeding is widely practiced in Nigeria, with 96 percent of children being breastfed. The median duration of breastfeeding is 19 months. Although it is recommended that children be exclusively breastfed with no supplements for the first 4 to 6 months, only 20 percent of children 0-3 months are exclusively breasffed, as are 8 percent of children 4-6 months. Two-thirds of children 4-6 months are being given supplements in addition to breast milk. <br><br>In the NDHS, interviewers weighed and measured children under three born to women who were interviewed. Unfortunately, data were either missing or implausible for more than half of these children. Of the half with plausible data, 46 percent of children under 3 are classified as stunted (low height-for-age), 12 percent are wasted (low weight-for-height) and 27 percent are underweight (low weight-for-age). <br><br>The 1999 NDHS also collected information on the nutritional status of women who had a birth in the three years prior to the survey. Sixteen percent of these women are considered to be too thin, with a body mass index of less than 18.5. Women of short stature (height less than 145 cm) comprise 7 percent of the women measured. <br><br>HIV/AIDS and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases <br><br>Survey data indicate that awareness of HIWAIDS is becoming more widespread. Three-quarters of women and 90 percent of men in Nigeria have heard of AIDS. The radio and relatives and friends are the most commonly cited sources of information about HIV/AIDS among both women and men. However, knowledge of ways to avoid HIV/AIDS is not so widespread. More than a quarter of women and 14 percent of men say they do not know of any way to avoid HIV/AIDS and 6 percent of women and 3 percent of men say there is no way to avoid it. Only 14 percent of women and 29 percent of men say that using condoms is a means of avoiding the disease. On the other hand, three in five men and women who have heard of AIDS know that ahealthy-looking person can be infected with the AIDS virus and over 80 percent know that AIDS is a fatal disease that cannot be cured. <br>Two-thirds of Nigerian women and men believe that they have no chance of contracting HIV/AIDS, while almost all the rest believe their chances are small. Perhaps one reason is that many Nigerians say they have changed their sexual behavior to avoid getting AIDS. For example, 37 percent of women and 42 percent of men say they restrict themselves to only one pamler; one-fourth of the women say they asked their partners to remain faithful. Condoms are acknowledged by a large majority of respondents to be a way of preventing HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases. Men are almost twice as likely (38 percent) as women (20 percent) to have ever used condoms either for family planning or disease prevention. However, only 7 percent of women and 15 percent of men reported having used a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse. The most widely known sexually transmitted disease apart from AIDS is gonorrhoea.",0049349,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Nigeria - Demographic and Health Survey 2003,"The 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2003 NDHS) is the third national Demographic and Health Survey conducted in Nigeria. The 2003 NDHS is based on a nation­ally representative sample of over 7,000 house­holds. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men age 15-59 in a subsample of one-third of the households were individually inter­viewed. The survey provides up-to-date infor­mation on the population and health situation in Nigeria. <br><br>The 2003 NDHS was designed to provide estimates for key indicators such as fertility, contracep­tive use, infant and child mortality, immunization levels, use of family planning, maternal and child health, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of mothers and young children, use of mosquito nets, female genital cutting, marriage, sexual activity, and awareness and behaviour regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections in Nigeria. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Levels, Trends, and Preferences. The total fertility rate (TFR) in Nigeria is 5.7. This means that at current fertility levels, the av­erage Nigerian woman who is at the beginning of her childbearing years will give birth to 5.7 children by the end of her lifetime. Compared with previous national surveys, the 2003 survey shows a modest decline in fertility over the last two decades: from a TFR of 6.3 in the 1981-82 National Fertility Survey (NFS) to 6.0 in the 1990 NDHS to 5.7 in the 2003 NDHS. How­ever, the 2003 NDHS rate of 5.7 is significantly higher than the 1999 NDHS rate of 5.2. Analysis has shown that the 1999 survey underestimated the true levels of fertility in Nigeria. <br><br>On average, rural women will have one more child than urban women (6.1 and 4.9, respectively). Fertility varies considerably by region of residence, with lower rates in the south and higher rates in the north. Fertility also has a strong negative correlation with a woman's educational attainment. <br><br>Most Nigerians, irrespective of their number of living children, want large families. The ideal num­ber of children is 6.7 for all women and 7.3 for cur­rently married women. Nigerian men want even more children than women. The ideal number of children for all men is 8.6 and for currently married men is 10.6. Clearly, one reason for the slow decline in Nigerian fertility is the desire for large families. <br><br>- FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Knowledge of Family Planning Methods. About eight in ten women and nine in ten men know at least one modern method of family planning. The pill, injectables, and the male condom are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. Mass media is an important source of information on family planning. Radio is the most frequent source of family planning messages: 40 percent of women and 56 percent of men say they heard a radio message about family planning during the months preceding the survey. However, more than half of women (56 percent) and 41 percent men were not exposed to family plan­ning messages from a mass media source.  <br><br>Current Use. A total of 13 percent of cur­rently married women are using a method of family planning, including 8 percent who are us­ing a modern method. The most common mod­ern methods are the pill, injectables, and the male condom (2 percent each). Urban women are more than twice as likely as rural women to use a method of contraception (20 percent versus 9 percent). Contraceptive use varies significantly by region. For example, one-third of married women in the South West use a method of con­traception compared with just 4 percent of women in the North East and 5 percent of women in the North West.  <br><br>- CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Mortality. The 2003 NDHS survey estimates infant mortality to be 100 per 1,000 live births for the 1999-2003 period. This infant mortality rate is significantly higher than the estimates from both the 1990 and 1999 NDHS surveys; the earlier surveys underestimated mortality levels in certain regions of the country, which in turn biased downward the na­tional estimates. Thus, the higher rate from the 2003 NDHS is more likely due to better data quality than an actual increase in mortality risk overall.  <br><br>The rural infant mortality rate (121 per 1,000) is considerably higher than the urban rate (81 per 1,000), due in large part to the difference in neonatal mortality rates. As in other countries, low maternal education, a low position on the household wealth index, and shorter birth intervals are strongly associ­ated with increased mortality risk. The under-five mortality rate for the 1999-2003 period was 201 per 1,000.  <br><br>Vaccinations. Only 13 percent of Nigerian children age 12-23 months can be considered fully vaccinated, that is, have received BCG, measles, and three doses each of DPT and polio vaccine (exclud­ing the polio vaccine given at birth). This is the low­est vaccination rate among African countries in which DHS surveys have been conducted since 1998. Less than half of children have received each of the recommended vaccinations, with the excep­tion of polio 1 (67 percent) and polio 2 (52 percent). More than three times as many urban children as ru­ral children are fully vaccinated (25 percent and 7 percent, respectively). WHO guidelines are that children should complete the schedule of recom­mended vaccinations by 12 months of age. In Nige­ria, however, only 11 percent of children age 12-23 months received all of the recommended vacci­nations before their first birthday.  <br><br>- WOMEN'S HEALTH <br><br>Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is almost uni­versal in Nigeria, with 97 percent of children born in the five years preceding the survey hav­ing been breastfed. However, just one-third of children were given breast milk within one hour of birth (32 percent), and less than two-thirds were given breast milk within 24 hours of birth (63 percent). Overall, the median duration of any breastfeeding is 18.6 months, while the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding is only half a month. <br><br>Complementary Feeding. At age 6-9 months, the recommended age for introducing complementary foods, three-quarters of breast-feeding infants received solid or semisolid foods during the day or night preceding the interview; 56 percent received food made from grains, 25 percent received meat, fish, shellfish, poultry or eggs, and 24 percent received fruits or vegeta­bles. Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin A were consumed by 20 percent of breastfeeding infants age 6-9 months. <br><br>Maternal Care. Almost two-thirds of mothers in Nigeria (63 percent) received some antenatal care (ANC) for their most recent live birth in the five years preceding the survey. While one-fifth of moth­ers (21 percent) received ANC from a doctor, almost four in ten women received care from nurses or midwives (37 percent). Almost half of women (47 percent) made the minimum number of four recom­mended visits, but most of the women who received antenatal care did not get care within the first three months of pregnancy.  <br><br>In terms of content of care, slightly more than half of women who received antenatal care said that they were informed of potential pregnancy compli­cations (55 percent). Fifty-eight percent of women received iron tablets; almost two-thirds had a urine or blood sample taken; and 81 percent had their blood pressure measured. Almost half (47 percent) received no tetanus toxoid injections during their most recent birth.  <br><br>WOMEN'S CHARACTERISTICS AND STATUS <br><br>Across all maternal care indicators, rural women are disadvantaged compared with urban women, and there are marked regional differ­ences among women. Overall, women in the south, particularly the South East and South West, received better care than women in the north, especially women in the North East and North West. <br><br>Female Circumcision. Almost one-fifth of Nigerian women are circumcised, but the data suggest that the practice is declining. The oldest women are more than twice as likely as the youngest women to have been circumcised (28 percent versus 13 percent). Prevalence is highest among the Yoruba (61 percent) and Igbo (45 percent), who traditionally reside in the South West and South East. Half of the circumcised respondents could not identify the type of proce­dure performed. Among those women who could identify the type of procedure, the most common type of circumcision involved cutting and removal of flesh (44 percent of all circum­cised women). Four percent of women reported that their vaginas were sewn closed during cir­cumcision.  <br><br>MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM INDICATORS <br><br>Nets. Although malaria is a major public health concern in Nigeria, only 12 percent of households report owning at least one mosquito net. Even fewer, 2 percent of households, own an insecticide treated net (ITN). Rural households are almost three times as likely as urban households to own at least one mosquito net. Overall, 6 percent of children under age five sleep under a mosquito net, including 1 percent of children who sleep under an ITN. Five percent of pregnant women slept under a mosquito net the night before the survey, one-fifth of them under an ITN.  <br><br>Use of Antimalarials. Overall, 20 percent of women reported that they took an antimalarial for prevention of malaria during their last preg­nancy in the five years preceding the survey. Another 17 percent reported that they took an unknown drug, and 4 percent took paracetamol or herbs to prevent malaria. Only 1 percent re­ceived intermittent preventative treatment (IPT)-or preventive treatment with sulfadox­ine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar/SP) during an an­tenatal care visit. Among pregnant women who took an antimalarial, more than half (58 percent) used Daraprim, which has been found to be inef­fective as a chemoprophylaxis during preg­nancy. Additionally, 39 percent used chloro­quine, which was the chemoprophylactic drug of choice until the introduction of IPT in Nigeria in 2001.  <br><br>Among children who were sick with fe­ver/convulsions, one-third took antimalarial drugs, the majority receiving the drugs the same day as the onset of the fever/convulsions or the following day. <br><br>HIV/AIDS AND OTHER STIS <br><br>Knowledge. Almost all men (97 percent) and a majority of women (86 percent) reported that they had heard of AIDS. Considerably fewer know how to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus; men are better informed than women. Sixty-three percent of men and 45 per­cent of women reported knowing that condom use protects against HIV/AIDS. More respon-dents (six in ten women and eight in ten men) reported knowing that limiting the number of sexual partners is a way to avoid HIV/AIDS. Less than half of the population knows that mother to child trans­mission of HIV is possible through breastfeeding. Few people (less than one in ten) know that a woman living with HIV can take drugs during preg­nancy to reduce the risk of transmission. <br><br>HIV Testing and Counselling. Six percent of women and 14 percent of men have been tested for HIV and received the results of their test. During the 12 months preceding the survey, only 3 percent of women and 6 percent of men were tested and re­ceived their test results. About one-quarter of women received counselling or information about HIV/AIDS during an antenatal care visit. <br><br>High-risk Sex. A much higher percentage of men than women report having had sex with a non-marital, noncohabiting partner at some time during the year preceding the survey (39 percent of men versus 14 percent of women). Less than half of men (47 percent) and less than one-quarter of women (23 percent) reported using a condom the last time they had sex with a nonmarital, noncohabiting partner. Fifteen percent of men who are currently married or cohabiting reported having high-risk sex in the past 12 months.  <br><br>Sexually Transmitted Infections. Five percent of both women and men reported having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or an associated symp­tom during the 12 months preceding the survey. The never-married population of both women and men are most at risk. Eight percent of never-married women and 7 percent of never-married men reported having an STI or STI symptom. Of these, 68 percent of women and 83 percent of men sought treatment for their STI or STI symptom; however, not every­one went to a health professional. <br><br>Orphanhood. Nationwide, fewer than 1 per­cent of children have lost both parents; 6 percent of children under age 15 have lost at least one parent.",0049344,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nigeria - Demographic and Health Survey 2008,"The 2008 Nigeria Demographic Health Sur­vey (NDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 33,385 women age 15-49 and 15,486 men age 15-59. The 2008 NDHS is the fourth comprehen­sive survey conducted in Nigeria as part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) pro­gramme. The data are intended to furnish pro­gramme managers and policymakers with de­tailed information on levels and trends in fertil­ity; nuptiality; sexual activity; fertility prefer­ences; awareness and use of family planning methods; infants and young children feeding practices; nutritional status of mothers and young children; early childhood mortality and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; and aware­ness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Addition­ally, the 2008 NDHS collected information on malaria prevention and treatment, neglected tropical diseases, domestic violence, fistulae, and female genital cutting (FGC). <br><br>The 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2008 NDHS) was implemented by the National Population Commission from June to October 2008 on a nationally representative sample of more than 36,000 households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men age 15-59 in a sub-sample of half of the households were individually interviewed. <br><br>While significantly expanded in content, the 2008 NDHS is a follow-up to the 1990, 1999, and 2003 NDHS surveys and provides updated estimates of basic demographic and health indicators covered in these earlier surveys. In addition, the 2008 NDHS includes the collection of information on violence against women. Although previous surveys collected data at the national and zonal levels, the 2008 NDHS is the first NDHS survey to collect data on basic demographic and health indicators at the state level. <br><br>The primary objectives of the 2008 NDHS project were to provide up-to-date information on fertility levels; nuptiality; sexual activity; fertility preferences; awareness and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; nutritional status of mothers and young children; early childhood mortality and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; and awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. <br><br>MAIN FINDINGS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>The survey results show fertility in Nigeria has remained at a high level over the last 17 years from 5.9 births per woman in 1991 to 5.7 births in 2008. On average, rural women are hav­ing two children more than urban women (6.3 and 4.7 children, respectively). Fertility differen­tials by education and wealth are noticeable. Women who have no formal education and women in the lowest wealth quintile on average are having 7 children, while women with higher than a secondary education are having 3 children and women in the highest wealth quintile are having 4 children.  <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>In the 2008 NDHS, 72 percent of all women and 90 percent of all men know at least one con­traceptive method. Male condoms, the pill, and injectables are the most widely known methods. <br><br>Twenty-nine percent of currently married women have used a family planning method at least once in their lifetime. Fifteen percent of currently married women are using any contra­ceptive method and 10 percent are using a mod­ern method. The most commonly used methods among currently married women are injectables (3 percent), followed by male condoms and the pill (2 percent each). <br><br>Current use of contraception in Nigeria has increased from 6 percent in 1990 and 13 percent in 2003 to 15 percent in 2008. There has been a corresponding increase in the use of modern con­traceptive methods, from 4 percent in 1990 and 8 percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2008. <br><br>CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Data from the 2008 NDHS indicate that the infant mortality rate is 75 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the under-five mortality rate is 157 per 1,000 live births for the five-year period im­mediately preceding the survey. The neonatal mortality rate is 40 per 1,000 births. Thus, almost half of childhood deaths occurred during infancy, with one-quarter taking place during the first month of life. <br><br>Child mortality is consistently lower in urban areas than in rural areas. There is also variation in the mortality level across zones. The infant mortality and under-five mortality rates are high­est in the North East, and lowest in the South West. <br><br>In Nigeria, children are considered fully vac­cinated when they receive one dose of BCG vac­cine, three doses of DPT vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine. Overall, 23 percent of children 12-23 months have received all vaccinations at the time of the survey. Fifty percent of children have received the BCG vaccination, and 41 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage of the first dose of DPT vaccine and polio 1 is 52 and 68 percent, respectively). However, only 35 per­cent of children have received the third dose of DPT vaccine, and 39 percent have received the third dose of polio vaccine. A comparison of the 2008 NDHS results with those of the earlier sur­veys shows there has been an increase in the overall vaccination coverage in Nigeria from 13 percent in 2003 to the current rate of 23 percent. However, the percentage of children with no vaccinations has not improved for the same pe­riod, 27 percent in 2003 and 29 percent in 2008. <br><br>MATERNAL HEALTH <br><br>In Nigeria more than half of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a health profes­sional (58 percent); 23 percent from a doctor, 30 percent from a nurse or midwife, and 5 percent from an auxiliary nurse or midwife. Thirty-six percent of mothers did not receive any antenatal care. <br><br>Tetanus toxoid injections are given during pregnancy to prevent neonatal tetanus. Overall, 48 percent of last births in Nigeria were pro­tected against neonatal tetanus. <br><br>More than one-third of births in the five years before the survey were delivered in a health facility (35 percent). Twenty percent of births occurred in public health facilities and 15 percent occurred in private health facilities. Al­most two-thirds (62 percent) of births occurred at home. Nine percent of births were assisted by a doctor, 25 percent by a nurse or midwife, 5 per­cent by an auxiliary nurse or midwife, and 22 percent by a traditional birth attendant. Nineteen percent of births were assisted by a relative and 19 percent of births had no assistance at all. Two percent of births were delivered by a caesarean section. <br><br>Overall, 42 percent of mothers received a postnatal check-up for the most recent birth in the five years preceding the survey, with 38 per­cent having the check-up within the critical 48 hours after delivery. <br><br>Results from the 2008 NDHS show that the estimated maternal mortality ratio during the seven-year period prior to the survey is 545 ma­ternal deaths per 100,000 live births. <br><br>BREASTFEEDING AND NUTRITION <br><br>Ninety-seven percent of Nigerian children under age five were breastfed at some point in their life. The median breastfeeding duration in Nigeria is long (18.1 months). On the other hand, the median duration for exclusive breastfeeding is only for half a month. A small proportion of babies (13 percent) are exclusively breastfed throughout the first six months of life. More than seven in ten (76 percent) children age 6-9 months receive complementary foods. Sixteen percent of babies less than six months of age are fed with a bottle with a nipple, and the proportion bottle-fed peaks at 17 percent among children in the age groups 2-3 months and 4-5 months. <br><br>Anthropometric measurements carried out at the time of the survey indicate that, overall, 41 percent of Nigerian children are stunted (short for their age), 14 percent are wasted (thin for their height), and 23 percent are underweight. The indices show that malnutrition in young children increases with age, starting with wast­ing, which peaks among children age 6-8 months, underweight peaks among children age 12-17 months, and stunting is highest among children age 18-23 months. Stunting affects half of children in this age group and almost one-third of children age 18-23 months are severely stunted. <br><br>Overall, 66 percent of women have a body mass index (BMI) in the normal range; 12 per­cent of women are classified as thin and 4 per­cent are severely thin. Twenty-two percent of women are classified as overweight or obese, with 6 percent in the latter category. <br><br>MALARIA <br><br>Seventeen percent of all households inter­viewed during the survey had at least one mos­quito net, while 8 percent had more than one. Sixteen percent of households had at least one net that had been treated at some time (ever-treated) with an insecticide. Eight percent of households had at least one insecticide-treated net (ITN). <br><br>Mosquito net usage is low among young children and pregnant women, groups that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of malaria. Overall, 12 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net the night before the survey. Twelve percent of children slept under an ever-treated net and 6 percent slept under an ITN. Among pregnant women, 12 percent slept under any mosquito net the night before the interview. Twelve percent slept under an ever-treated net and 5 percent slept under an ITN.  <br><br>Among women who had their last birth in the two years before the survey, 18 percent took an anti-malarial drug during the pregnancy. Eleven percent of all pregnant women took at least one dose of a sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) drug such as Fansidar, Amalar, or Maloxine, while 7 percent reported taking two or more doses of an SP drug. Eight percent of the women who took an SP drug were given the drug during an antena­tal care visit, a practice known as intermittent preventive treatment (IPT). <br><br>HIV/AIDS KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOUR <br><br>The majority of women (88 percent) and men (94 percent) age 15-49 have heard of HIV or AIDS. However, only 23 percent of women and 36 percent of men have what can be considered comprehensive knowledge about the modes of HIV transmission and prevention. Comprehen­sive knowledge means knowing that using con­doms and having just one uninfected, faithful partner can reduce the chance of getting HIV, knowing that a healthy-looking person can have HIV, and rejecting the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission or pre­vention, that HIV and AIDS can be transmitted through supernatural means or through mosquito bites. <br>Fifty-two percent of women and 59 percent of men age 15-49 know that HIV can be trans­mitted through breastfeeding. Twenty-eight per­cent of women and 39 percent of men know that the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) can be reduced by the mother taking special drugs during pregnancy. <br><br>Given that most HIV cases in Nigeria occur as a result of heterosexual contact, information about the level of higher-risk sexual intercourse (i.e., sexual intercourse with a non-marital, non-cohabiting partner) in the past 12 months is im­portant for planning HIV prevention pro­grammes. The 2008 NDHS findings indicate that 1 percent of women and 10 percent of men had two or more sexual partners during the 12 months preceding the survey. Ten percent of women and 23 percent of men had higher-risk sexual intercourse in this period. Among these respondents, only 33 percent of women and 54 percent of men reported that they used a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse with a higher-risk sexual partner. <br><br>Among the adult population age 15-49, 17 percent of women and 15 percent of men have been tested for HIV at some time. Seven percent of women and 7 of men received the results from their last HIV test that was taken in the past 12 months. <br><br>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE <br><br>One eligible woman in each household was asked questions on domestic violence. In Nige­ria, domestic violence occurs across all socio­economic and cultural backgrounds. Twenty-eight percent of all women reported experiencing physical violence since the age of 15, and 15 percent of women experienced physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. Among women who experienced violence since age 15, a total of 45 percent reported that their current husband or partner was the perpetrator and 7 per­cent reported that the perpetrator was a former husband or partner.  <br><br>Overall, 7 percent of women reported that they had experienced sexual violence at some time in their lives. Forty-three percent of women reported that their first experience with sexual intercourse occurred when they were less than 20 years of age. Half of women reported that their current or former husband, partner, or boyfriend committed the act of sexual violence. It is impor­tant to highlight that among women who were younger than age 15 when they first experienced sexual violence, 28 percent reported that the per­petrator was a stranger, 12 percent reported that the person was a friend or acquaintance, 11 per­cent reported that the person was a relative, and 7 percent reported that the person was a family friend. <br><br>Thirty-four percent of Nigerian women who ever experienced physical or sexual violence sought help to stop the violence. Eight percent of abused women did not seek help but did tell someone about the violence, and 45 percent of the women did not seek help from any source and did not tell anyone about the violence. <br><br>ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN <br><br>Twelve percent Nigerian children under age 18 in the households sampled in the 2008 NDHS were not living with a biological parent. Six per­cent of children under age 18 are orphaned, that is, one or both parents are dead.  <br>Earlier NDHS surveys obtained information on orphanhood only for children under age 15. A comparison of the results from the 2003 and 2008 surveys for this age group indicates that there has been a slight decrease in orphanhood from 6.2 percent to 5.2 percent. The proportion of children who are not living with either parent decreased from 11 to 9 percent for children under age 15. <br><br>Overall, 5 percent of children under age 18 are considered vulnerable, i.e., they live in a household in which at least one adult was chronically ill for three months during the past 12 months, or they had a parent living in the household (or elsewhere) who had experienced chronic illness in the past year. Overall, 11 per­cent of children under age 18 are considered or­phans and/or vulnerable.",0049338,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Nigeria - General Household Survey, Panel  2012-2013","In the past decades, Nigeria has experienced substantial gaps in producing adequate and timely data to inform policy making. In particular, the country is lagging behind in producing sufficient and accurate agricultural production statistics. The current set of household and farm surveys conducted by the NBS covers a wide range of sectors. Except for the Harmonized National Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) which covers multiple topics, these different sectors are usually covered in separate surveys none of which is conducted as a panel. As part of the efforts to continue to improve data collection and usability, the NBS has revised the content of the annual General household survey (GHS) and added a panel component. The GHS-Panel is conducted every 2 years covering multiple sectors with a focus to improve data from the agriculture sector.  <br><br>The Nigeria General Hosehold Survey-Panel, is the result of a partnership that NBS has established with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMA&RD), the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the World Bank (WB). Under this partnership, a method to collect agricultural and household data in such a way as to allow the study of agriculture's role in household welfare over time was developed. This GHS-Panel Survey responds to the needs of the country, given the dependence of a high percentage of households on agriculture activities in the country, for information on household agricultural activities along with other information on the households like human capital, other economic activities, access to services and resources. The ability to follow the same households over time, makes the GHS-Panel a new and powerful tool for studying and understanding the role of agriculture in household welfare over time as it allows analyses to be made of how households add to their human and physical capital, how education affects earnings and the role of government policies and programs on poverty, inter alia. <br><br>The objectives of the survey are as follows<br>i   Allowing welfare levels to be produced at the state level using small area estimation techniques resulting in state-level poverty figures<br>ii  With the integration of the longitudinal panel survey with GHS, it will be possible to conduct a more comprehensive analysis  of poverty indicators and socio-economic characteristics <br>iii  Support the development and implementation of a Computer  Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) application for the paperless collection of GHS<br>iv Developing an innovative model for collecting agricultural data<br>v  Capacity building and developing sustainable systems for the production of accurate and timely information on agricultural households in Nigeria.<br>vi Active dissemination of agriculture statistics<br><br>The second wave consists of two visits to the household: the postplanting visit occurred directly after the planting season to collect information on preparation of plots, inputs used, labour used for planting and other issues related to the planting season.

Niger - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1992,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Niger OEDSN) a été exécutée par la Direction de la Statistique et des Comptes Nationaux en collaboration avec certaines Directions techniques du Ministère de la Santé Publique et du Ministère du Développement Social, de la Population et de la Promotion de la Femme, et avec l'assistance technique de Macro International Inc. Il s'agit d'une enquête par sondage, réalisée au niveau national, dont les objectifs 6taient de fournir des informations détaillé.es sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant, l'état nutritionnel des enfants de moins de cinq ans, la mortalité infanto-juvénile et la mortalité maternelle. Cet ensemble d'informations, couplées aux résultats du Recensement Général de la Population (RGP) de 1988, fournissent une vue d'ensemble de la situation démographique et sanitaire du Niger. <br><br>Au cours de I'EDSN, réalisée sur le terrain entre mars et juin 1992, 5 242 ménages, 6 503 femmes en âge de procréer (15-49 ans) et 1 570 maris ont été enquêtés avec succès. Les caractéristiques de la population obtenues à partir de l'enquête ménage, en particulier la structure par âge et sexe et la répartition par milieu et région de résidence sont très proches des résultats du RGP 1988. Ceci témoigne de la bonne représentativité de l'échantillon de I'EDSN. <br><br>Conformément au programme international des EDS, I'EDSN vise les objectifs suivants : <br>1. recueillir, à l'échelle nationale, les données permettant de calculer des taux démographiques et plus particulièrement les taux de fécondité et de mortalité infantile; <br>2. analyser les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent le niveau et les tendances de la fécondité; <br>3. analyser les facteurs directs et indioects qui déterminent le niveau et les tendances de la mortalité; <br>4. mesurer les taux de connaissance et de pratique contraceptive par méthode, par milieu d'habitat et selon les secteurs de distribution de la contraception; <br>5. recueillir des données de qualité sur la santé familiale; pour les enfants de moins de 5 ans : vaccination contre les 6 maladies du Programme Elargi de Vaccination (PEV), prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies, mortalité infantile et juvénile; pour les femmes en fige de procréation : visites prénatales, assistance à l'accouchement et allaitement au sein; <br>6. mesurer l'état nutritionnel des mères et des enfants de moins de cinq ans (mesures anthropométriques : taille et poids); <br>7. développer au niveau du pays les capacités et les ressources nécessaires å la réalisation périodique d'enquêtes démographiques et de santé. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>Les femmes nigériennes ont une fécondité très élevée, l'une des plus élevée en Afrique : avec les niveaux actuels, une femme donnera naissance en moyenne à 7,4 enfants durant sa vie féconde. L'une des principales caractéristiques de cette fécondité est sa précocité : une femme sur deux donne naissance à son premier enfant avant l'âge de 18 ans. Par ailleurs, les niveaux de fécondité présentent de fortes variations selon le milieu de résidence et le niveau d'instruction. Les femmes du milieu rural (7,5 enfants par femme) donnent naissance, en moyenne, à 1,6 enfants de plus que celles de Niamey (5,9 enfants par femme). De même, les femmes sans instruction (7,5 enfants par femme) ont, en moyenne, plus de 1 enfant de plus que celles qui ont fréquent~ l'école (6,3 enfants par femme). <br><br>Parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans, 86 pour cent étaient mariées au moment de l'enquête et, à partir de 30 ans, moins de 1 pour cent des femmes restent célibataire : ainsi, le mariage qui demeure le cadre presque exclusif de la procréation, est quasi universel au Niger. En outre, plus d'une femme mariée sur trois (36 pour cent) vit en union polygame. L'entrée en union est très précoce : à 18 ans, 89 pour cent des femmes sont déjà mariées et l'âge médian au premier mariage est de 15,1 ans. Les premiers rapports sexuels se produisent également très tôt (âge médian de 14,9 ans). Cette précocité des premiers rapports sexuels et du mariage expliquent la précocité de la fécondité. En outre, aucune tendance ne semble se dessiner dans le sens d'une modification de l'âge d'entrée en union, même si les femmes de Niamey et surtout celles ayant fréquenté l'école se marient plus tardivement (respectivement, âges médians de 16,2 et 17,1 ans) que les femmes du milieu rural et que celles sans instruction (âge médian de 15,0 ans). <br><br>Plus de trois femmes sur quatre (76 pour cent) connaissent au moins une méthode contraceptive, mais les méthodes traditionnelles, en particulier les gris-gris, sont mieux connus que les méthodes modernes (65 pour cent contre 58 pour cent). Malgré ce niveau de connaissance relativement élevé, seule une très faible proportion de femmes nigériennes (4 pour cent) utilisent la contraception; en outre, les méthodes modernes (2 pour cent) et traditionnelles (2 pour cent) sont utilisées en même proportion. Comme pour la fécondité, les niveaux d'utilisation de la contraception varient fortement selon le milieu de résidence et le niveau d'instruction. A Niamey, 21 pour cent des femmes mariées utilisent la contraception et la grande majorité d'entre elles utilisent une méthode moderne (17 pour cent), alors que la prévalence contraceptive n'est que de 2,5 pour cent en milieu rural. De même, 16 pour cent des femmes ayant fréquenté l'école utilisent une méthode de contraception, et surtout une méthode moderne (11 pour cent), alors que la prévalence n'atteint pas 4 pour cent parmi les femmes sans instruction. <br><br>Méme si une part non négligeable de femmes non-utilisatrices de la contraception (15 pour cent) expliquent leur comportement par le fait qu'elles manquent d'informations, la majorité d'entre elles (51 pour cent) n'utilisent pas de méthodes parce qu'elles souhaitent avoir des enfants. Le désir d'enfants est donc très élevée : seulement 9 pour cent des enquêtées ont déclaré ne plus en vouloir et une proportion encore plus faible des matis interrogés (2 pour cent) ont exprimé le même souhait. En fait, si elles n'avaient que les enfants qu'elles désirent, les femmes nigériennes auraient une fécondité (7,1 enfants par femme) très proche de la fécondité actuelle (7,4 enfants par femme). Ainsi, si la demande potentielle totale en planification familiale concerne 24 pour cent des femmes, seule une faible part de cette demande (6 pour cent) est orientée vers la limitation des naissances, l'objectif principal étant d'espacer les naissances et non de les limiter. <br>L'EDSN fournit également un ensemble d'informations très importantes sur la santé et l'état nutritionnel de la mère et de l'enfant. <br><br>Concernant les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouchement, on constate que pour 30 pour cent seulement des naissances des cinq dernières années, la mère est allée en consultation prénatale; dans 23 pour cent des cas seulement, elle a reçu au moins une injection antitétanique pendant la grossesse; l'accouchement n'a eu lieu dans une formation sanitaire que pour 15 pour cent des naissances; un professionnel de la santé a assisté 15 pour cent des accouchements et une accoucheuse traditionnelle formée 18 pour cent des naissances : la grande majorité des naissances (67 pour cent) ont eu lieu sans l'assistance de personnel spécialisé, voire sans aucune assistance (17 pour cent). En outre, on constate d'énormes différences du point de vue du niveau d'instruction de la mère et surtout du point de vue du milieu de résidence : pour 86 pour cent des naissances, les mères ont bénéficié de soins prénatals en milieu urbain contre seulement 20 pour cent en milieu rural, et 70 pour cent des accouchements du milieu urbain ont été assistés par des professionnels de la santé contre seulement 5 pour cent en milieu rural. <br><br>La vaccination contre les maladies-cible du Programme Elargi de Vaccination (PEV), à savoir la tuberculose, la diphtérie, le tétanos, la coqueluche, la polio, la rougeole et la fièvre jaune, est un facteur clé d'amélioration du taux de survie des enfants. D'après I'EDSN, parmi les enfants de 12 à 23 mois qui, selon les recommandations de l'OMS, devraient être tous vaccinés contre les maladies-cible du PEV, 40 pour cent seulement sont vaccinés contre la tuberculose, 20 pour cent ont reçu les trois doses de DTCoq et de polio, et 28 pour cent seulement sont vaccinés contre la rougeole. Seulement 1 enfant nigérien sur 7 a reçu toutes les vaccinations du PEV et, à l'opposé, 6 enfants sur 10 n'ont reçu aucune de ces vaccinations. Ces taux de couverture vaccinale déjà très faibles au niveau national, masquent d'importantes disparités selon le milieu de résidence et le niveau d'instruction des mères: si 46 pour cent des enfants du milieu urbain sont complètement vaccinés, ce taux de couverture vaccinale n'atteint que 8 pour cent en milieu rural où, à l'opposé, 79 pour cent des enfants n'ont reçu aucune vaccination. De même, 33 pour cent des enfants dont la mère a fréquenté l'école sont complètement vaccinés, contre 12 pour cent seulement des enfants de mère sans instruction. <br><br>D'après les déclarations des mères, pendant les deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête, 11 pour cent des enfants de moins de 5 ans ont souffert de toux et de respiration courte et rapide, symptômes d'infections respiratoires aiguës, 45 pour cent des enfants ont souffert de fièvre qui peut être, dans de nombreux cas, un sympt6me du paludisme, et 28 pour cent des enfants ont eu un ou plusieurs épisodes diarrhéiques. Quelle que soit la maladie, une très faible proportion d'enfants (moins de 14 pour cent) ont été menés en consultation lorsqu'ils étaient malades, et une forte proportion d'enfants atteints (39 pour cent et plus) n'ont reçu aucun traitement. En particulier, 3 enfants sur 4, atteints de diarrhée, n'ont bénéficié d'aucune forme de Thérapie de Réhydratation par voie Oralc (TRO), alors que 57 pour cent des femmes ont déclaré connaître les sachets de SRO. <br><br>La quasi-totalité des enfants nigériens nés au cours des cinq années ayant précédé l'enquête (98 pour cent) ont été allaités, mais une très faible proportion d'entre eux (20 pour cent) ont et~ mis au sein dès la naissance. Alors que jusqu'à l'âge de 4-6 mois tous les enfants ne devraient recevoir rien d'autre que le sein, seulement 1 pour cent des enfants nigériens sont exclusivement allaités. Dès le premier mois les enfants reçoivent différents types de laits, de liquides et même d'aliments solides ou en bouillie, ce qui affecte leur état nutritionnel et augmente leur risque de contracter des maladies infectieuses. En moyenne, et quelle que soit les caractéristiques de la mère, les enfants sont allaités pendant environ 20 mois. <br><br>Près d'un enfant sur trois (32 pour cent) est atteint d'un retard de croissance qui révèle un état de sous-nutrition chronique, et près de la moitié de ces enfants sont affectés par la forme sévère de cette sous- nutrition. Près d'un enfant sur six (16 pour cent) est émacié, c'est-à-dire atteint de sous-nutrition aiguë. Cette situation nutritionnelle des enfants, déjà très préoccupante au niveau national, est encore plus alarmante au niveau de certaines sous-populations : ainsi, le retard de croissance atteint 43 pour cent des enfants du département de Maradi et 38 pour cent des enfants des départements de Zinder/Diffa, et l'émaciation affecte 19 pour cent des enfants du département de Tillabéri et 18 pour cent des enfants du département de Maradi. <br><br>Conséquence d'une situation sanitaire déficiente et d'un mauvais état nutritionnel, la mortalité des enfants nigériens est l'une des plus élevée au monde. Sur mille enfants qui naissent, 123 décèdent avant le premier anniversaire et, sur mille enfants qui atteignent 1 an, 223 décèdent avant l'âge de 5 ans. Globalement, 1 enfant sur 3 accède entre la naissance et le cinquième anniversaire. Cette très forte mortalité qui semble n'avoir que peu évolué durant les quinze dernières années, présente, en outre, de fortes variations selon les caractéristiques des mères. C'est ainsi qu'entre la naissance et le cinquième anniversaire, la mortalité est deux fois plus élevée en milieu rural (347 pour mille) qu'à Niamey (157 pour mille) et qu'elle varie de 208 pour mille pour les enfants dont la mère a fréquent~ l'école å 334 pour mille pour les enfants de mère sans instruction. <br><br>Autre conséquence de cette situation sanitaire déficiente, les femmes courent un risque élevé de décéder par cause maternelle. Pour la période 1979-1992, 39 pour cent des décès de femmes se produisant aux âges de procréation sont imputables à des causes maternelles. Pour la même période, on estime que le taux de mortalité maternelle se situait entre 650 et 700 décès maternels pour 100 000 naissances : exprimé différemment, cela signifie qu'une femme court un risque de 1 sur 20 de décéder par cause maternelle durant sa vie féconde.",0049299,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Niger - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1998,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Niger (EDSN-II) est une enquête par sondage, représentative au niveau national. Elle a été exécutée par CARE International au Niger, avec l'assistance technique de Macro International Inc, à l'aide de financements de I'USAID et de l'Unicef. L'EDSN-II fournit des informations détaillées sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la santé maternelle et infantile, la pratique de l'excision, l'état nutritionnel des enfants et des mères, la mortalité infanto-juvénile, les Maladies Sexuellement Transmissibles (MST) et le sida. Au cours de l'enquête, réalisée sur le terrain de mars à juillet 1998, 5928 ménages, 7577 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans et 3589 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été interviewés avec succès. <br><br>Les informations recueillies sont significatives au niveau national et au niveau de chacun des six domaines d'études retenus dans le cadre de I'EDSN-II : ce sont la communauté urbaine de Niamey, les départements de Dosso, Maradi, Tillabéri et ceux d'Agadez/Tahoua et Zinder/Diffa. En ce qui concerne ces deux derniers domaines d'études, il a été décidé de coupler les départements afin que les données soient statistiquement représentatives. De plus, les données sont représentatives selon le milieu de résidence, à savoir, Niamey, les Autres Villes et le milieu rural. <br><br>L'un des principaux objectifs de I'EDSN-II était de recueillir, à l'échell e nationale, des données de qualité qui permettent de : <br>- connaître les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité infantile et juvénile, ainsi que les facteurs déterminant leur évolution; <br>- déterminer le niveau de connaissance et d'utilisation des méthodes de contraception chez les femmes et les hommes; <br>- obtenir des informations sur le nombre idéal d'enfants et sur l'attitude vis-à-vis de la planification familiale chez les femmes et les hommes en âge de procréer; <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur la santé maternelle et infantile : visites prénatales, assistance à l'accouchement, allaitement, vaccinations, supplémentation en Vitamine A, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies chez les enfants de moins de trois ans; <br>- déterminer l'état nutritionnel des mères et des enfants de moins de trois ans au moyen des mesures anthropométriques (poids et taille); <br><br>Enfin, l'EDSN-II a permis de développer les capacités nationales nécessaires à la réalisation périodique d'enquêtes démographiques et de santé. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>La fécondité des femmes nigériennes est la plus élevée du monde. Avec les niveaux actuels de fécondité, chaque femme aura 7,5 enfants à la fin de sa vie féconde. Le niveau de la fécondité présente des variations assez prononcées selon le milieu et la région de résidence. La fécondité du milieu rural (7,9 enfants) est nettement plus élevée que celle du milieu urbain (5,9 enfants). Avec 5,2 enfants par femme, Niamey se caractérise par le niveau le plus faible. C'est dans les départements de Maradi (8,7 enfants), de Zinder/Diffa et de Tillabéri (7,8 enfants) que l'on observe les niveaux les plus élevés. Par ailleurs, les femmes ayant un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus ont, en moyenne, 3 enfants de moins que celles qui n'ont jamais fréquenté l'école (4,6 contre 7,8). <br><br>La précocité de la fécondité explique, en grande partie, son niveau élevé. En effet, une femme de 25-49 ans sur deux a eu sa première naissance avant l'âge de 18 ans. De même, les adolescentes (15-19 ans) contribuent pour près de 14 % à la fécondité totale des femmes. Au moment de l'enquête, 36 % des adolescentes étaient déjà mères et 7 % étaient enceintes pour la première fois. La fécondité est plus précoce en milieu rural, où l'on enregistre 49 % d'adolescentes ayant commencé leur vie féconde, qu'en milieu urbain où cette proportion est de 24 %. Au nombre des facteurs qui expliquent les niveaux et la tendance de la fécondité, on peut citer la précocité du mariage et l'activité sexuelle. Ainsi, une femme de 25-49 ans sur deux était déjà en union à 15,1 ans et avait eu ses premiers rapports sexuels au même âge. Au Niger, le mariage est universel. Au moment de l'enquête, 84 % des femmes et 66 % des hommes étaient en union. Par ailleurs, la polygamie est très répandue : 38 % des femmes en union et 23 % des hommes en union vivent en union polygame. <br><br>Par ailleurs, l'utilisation très faible de moyens contraceptifs est un autre facteur qui explique le niveau élevé de la fécondité. Si les méthodes contraceptives modernes sont assez bien connues au Niger (75 % des femmes en union et 93 % des hommes en union ont déclaré connaître, au moins, une méthode contraceptive moderne), l'utilisation au moment de l'enquête reste néanmoins très faible. En effet, seulement 5 % des femmes en union et 8 % des hommes en union ont déclaré utiliser une méthode moderne de contraception au moment de l'enquête. L'utilisation de la contraception moderne par les femmes en union est près de dix fois plus importante en milieu urbain (19 %), qu'en milieu rural (2 %). Chez les hommes, la prévalence atteint 25 % en milieu urbain et 4 % en milieu rural. La méthode moderne la plus utilisée par les femmes et les hommes en union est la pilule (respectivement, 3 % et 5 %). Bien que l'utilisation des méthodes contraceptives modernes reste encore très faible, on constate que le niveau actuel est deux fois plus élevé chez les femmes en union que celui enregistré en 1992. <br><br>L'utilisation actuelle de la contraception est très faible chez les femmes en union, mais les besoins non-satisfaits en matière de planification familiale ne sont pas très importants. Moins d'une femme en union sur cinq (17 %) en exprime le besoin, l'espacement des naissances (14 %) demeurant la principale préoccupation. À l'heure actuelle, un tiers (33 %) de la demande potentielle totale en planification familiale chez les femmes en union se trouve satisfaite au Niger. Si tous les besoins en matière de planification familiale étaient couverts, la prévalence contraceptive des femmes en union ne serait que de 25 %, ce qui est néanmoins quatre fois plus élevé que la prévalence enregistrée. Il faut noter que la planification des naissances n'est pas un sujet de discussion entre les conjoints au Niger. Plus de deux femmes en union sur trois (69 %) n'ont jamais eu de discussion sur la planification familiale avec leur mari au cours des douze mois ayant précédé l'enquête. <br><br>Par ailleurs, on constate que les Nigériens restent attachés à une descendance nombreuse. Le nombre idéal moyen d'enfants est de 8,5 chez les femmes en union et de 12,3 chez les hommes en union. Pour cette raison, seulement 10 % des femmes et 4 % des hommes ont déclaré ne plus vouloir d'enfants. De ce fait, la fécondité désirée (7,2) est de même niveau que la fécondité actuelle (7,5), sauf dans le cas de Niamey, où on enregistre une fécondité désirée inférieure de près d'un enfant à ce qu'elle est actuellement (4,6 contre 5,2). D'autre part, I'EDSN-II a permis de recueillir des données sur la santé maternelle et infantile. En ce qui concerne les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouchement, on constate qu'an Niger, pour 40 % des naissances survenues dans les 3 années précédant l'enquête, les mères ont effectué une visite prénatale et que seulement un tiers d'entre elles (34 %) ont été protégées contre le tétanos néonatal, par, au moins, une dose de vaccin antitétanique. On constate des écarts importants selon le milieu de résidence. En milieu urbain, pour neuf naissances sur dix, les mères ont reçu des soins prénatals et sept mères sur dix ont été vaccinées contre le tétanos néonatal. Ces proportions sont, respectivement, de 96 % et 72 % à Niamey. En milieu rural, par contre, seulement 30 % des naissances ont bénéficié de consultations prénatales et 28 % de vaccinations antitétaniques. <br><br>En ce qui concerne les vaccinations des enfants, on constate que 47 % des enfants de 12-23 mois ont reçu le BCG, 25 % les trois doses de DTCoq et 24 %, celles de la Polio, et 35 % ont été vaccinés contre la rougeole. Au total, moins d'un enfant de 12-23 mois sur cinq (18 %) a reçu toutes les vaccinations du Programme Élargi de Vaccination (PEV). Parmi les enfants de 12-23 mois, 40 % n'avaient reçu aucune vaccination. La couverture vaccinale n'a pas évolué depuis 1992, où l'on avait enregistré 17 % d'enfants totalement vaccinés. Par contre, la proportion d'enfants n'ayant reçu aucun vaccin a considérablement diminué, les proportions étant passées de 60 % à 40 %. Par ailleurs, la couverture vaccinale est cinq fois plus importante en milieu urbain (54 % des enfants de 12-23 mois ont reçu toutes les vaccinations), et sept fois plus à Niamey (71%), qu'en milieu rural (11%). <br><br>Au Niger, les infections respiratoires aiguës et la diarrhée sont des problèmes de santé importants chez les enfants. Quatorze pour cent des enfants de moins de trois ans ont souffert de toux accompagnée de respiration courte et rapide au cours des deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête. De même, plus d'un enfant sur trois (38 %) a eu un ou plusieurs épisodes diarrhéiques durant les deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête. Au cours des épisodes diarrhéiques, quatre enfants sur cinq (79 %) n'ont bénéficié d'aucun type de réhydratation, et seulement 18 % ont été conduits dans un établissement de santé au cours de leur maladie. <br><br>Les mères nigériennes allaitent toutes leurs enfants. La proportion d'enfants de moins de 3 ans allaités est élevée à tous les âges (à 12-13 mois, 95 % des enfants sont encore allaités) et un enfant sur deux est allaité pendant 20,6 mois. Cependant, seulement 42 % des enfants ne sont mis au sein que 24 heures après leur naissance, ce qui peut se révéler néfaste pour leur santé. Par ailleurs, si l'allaitement est quasi général, l'allaitement exclusif est, quant à lui, pratiquement inexistant. En effet, moins de 1% des enfants de 0-3 mois sont exclusivement allaités au sein. A partir de 6 mois, tous les enfants devraient recevoir une alimentation de complément : 93 % des enfants nigériens de 7-9 mois sont nourris conformément à ces recommandations. <br><br>L'état nutritionnel des enfants nigériens de moins de 3 ans est alarmant. Les indices concernant l'état nutritionnel montrent qu'un enfant âgé de moins de 3 ans sur cinq (21%) est atteint d'émaciation, c'est-à- dire qu'il est trop maigre par rapport à sa taille. En outre, deux enfants sur cinq (41%) souffrent de malnutrition chronique, ou accusent un retard de croissance, c'est-à-dire sont trop petits pour leur âge. <br><br>Au Niger, la mortalité infanto-juvénile reste élevée. Durant la période 1993-1998, sur 1 000 naissances vivantes, 123 sont décédées avant d'atteindre l'âge d'un an, et sur 1 000 enfants atteignant leur premier anniversaire, 172 sont décédés avant d'atteindre 5 ans. Au total, plus d'un enfant sur quatre (274 %o) est décédé avant l'âge de 5 ans. Cependant, on constate que la mortalité infanto-juvénile semble avoir amorcé une baisse sensible puisque son niveau était de 318 %o pour la période 1988-1992. <br><br>La pratique de l'excision est peu courante au Niger et de ce fait, elle semble peu connue des femmes de 15-49 ans. Seulement 28 % d'entre elles ont déclaré en avoir entendu parler et seulement 5 % sont excisées. Près d'un tiers des femmes ont subi cette pratique entre 0 et 4 ans et l'âge médian s'établit à 5,8 ans. De plus, dans la majorité des cas (85 %), l'excision est pratiquée par des tradi-praticien et plus spécifiquement, par des exciseuses. D'autre part, 49 % des femmes de 15-49 ans connaissant l'excision se prononcent pour l'abandon de cette pratique. <br><br>Au Niger, moins d'une femme sur deux (48 %) a déclaré connaître des Maladies Sexuellement Transmissibles (MST). Le niveau de connaissance des hommes est plus élevé puisque 86 % d'entre eux ont déclaré qu'ils connaissaient les MST. Quant au sida, 55 % des femmes et 89 % ont déclaré le connaître. Cependant, parmi les personnes qui ont déclaré connaître le sida, une proportion non négligeable (31% des femmes et 23 % des hommes) ne connaissent aucun moyen de protection. De plus, seulement 1% des femmes et 9 % des hommes qui connaissent la maladie ont déclaré utiliser le condom comme moyen de protection contre le sida.",0049297,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Niger - Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples 2006,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples (EDSN-MICS III) de 2006 est la troisième du genre réalisée au Niger après celles de 1992 et de 1998. Elle a été réalisée de janvier à mai 2006 par l'Institut National de la Statistique (INS) avec l'assistance technique de Macro International Inc, société américaine en charge du programme international des Enquêtes Démographiques et de Santé (DHS), et avec la collaboration du Centre de Recherche Médicale et Sanitaire (CERMES) pour le test du VIH. En outre, elle a été exécutée grâce à l'appui financier du Fonds des Nations Unies pourl'Enfance (UNICEF), de l'Agence des États-Unis pour le Développement International (USAID), du Fonds des Nations Unies pour la Population (UNFPA), du Programme des Nations Unies pour le Développement (PNUD) par l'intermédiaire du Programme Bonne Gouvernance et Croissance Mieux Répartie, de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) et de la Banque Mondiale par le biais de la Coordination Intersectorielle de Lutte Contre les IST/VIH/SIDA (CISLS). <br><br>L'EDSN-MICS III fournit des informations sur les niveaux de fécondité, l'activité sexuelle, les préférences en matière de fécondité, la connaissance et l'utilisation des méthodes de planification familiale, les pratiques d'allaitement, l'état nutritionnel des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans, la mortalité infantile, la mortalité maternelle, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant ainsi que sur la connaissance, les attitudes et les comportements vis-à-vis du sida et autres infections sexuellement transmissibles. Des informations ont également été collectées sur l'utilisation des moustiquaires ; en outre, au cours de cette enquête, un test de séroprévalence a éte effectué qui a permis d'estimer la prévalence du VIH et de l'anémie. Les informations qui ont été collectées permettent la mise à jour des indicateurs de base sur la situation démographique et sanitaire estimés lors des précédentes enquêtes de 1992 et 1998. <br><br>Au cours de l'enquête, 7660 ménages ont été enquêtés avec succès (soit un taux de réponse de 98 %). Dans ces ménages, 9223 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans et 3549 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été interviewés avec succès et, parmi eux, 4406 femmes de 15-49 ans et 3267 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été effectivement testés pour le VIH. <br><br>Les informations recueillies au cours de l'enquête sont représentatives au niveau national, au niveau du milieu de résidence (urbain et rural) et au niveau des huit régions administratives du pays. <br><br>L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples (EDSN-MICS III) 2006 a pour objectif d'estimer de nombreux indicateurs socio-économiques, démographiques et sanitaires au niveau de l'ensemble de la population et au niveau des sous-populations des femmes de 15 à 49 ans, des enfants de moins de 5 ans et des hommes de 15 à 59 ans. En particulier, l'EDSN-MICS III vise à identifier et/ou à estimer : <br>Pour l'ensemble de la population : <br><br>Pour les femmes de 15-49 ans et les enfants de moins de cinq ans : <br>- divers indicateurs démographiques, en particulier les taux de fécondité, de mortalité des enfants et de mortalité maternelle ; <br>- les niveaux de scolarisation ;<br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et les tendances de la fécondité, tels que les comportements matrimoniaux, les comportements sexuels et l'utilisation de la contraception ; <br>- les niveaux d'utilisation du sel iodé ;<br>- certains indicateurs de bien-être des ménages<br>- les catégories des femmes susceptibles d'avoir plus ou moins d'enfants et susceptibles d'utiliser une méthode contraceptive;  <br>- les taux de connaissance et de pratique contraceptive par méthode, selon diverses caractéristiques sociodémographiques ; <br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la mortalité ; <br>- différentes composantes de la santé de la reproduction et de la santé des enfants : visites prénatales et postnatales, conditions d'accouchement, allaitement, vaccination, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans ; <br>- l'état nutritionnel des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans au moyen des mesures anthropométriques (poids et taille) ;  <br>- la prévalence de l'anémie des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans au moyen d'un test sanguin ; <br>- le niveau de connaissance, les opinions et attitudes vis-à-vis des Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et du VIH/sida ; <br>- le niveau de prévalence du VIH ; <br><br>Pour les hommes de 15-59 ans : <br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité, tels que les comportements matrimoniaux, les comportements sexuels et l'utilisation de la contraception  <br>- les catégories d'hommes susceptibles d'avoir plus ou moins d'enfants et susceptibles d'utiliser la contraception ; <br>- le niveau de connaissance, les opinions et attitudes vis-à-vis des Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et du VIH/SIDA ; <br>- la prévalence de l'anémie au moyen d'un test sanguin ; <br>- le niveau de prévalence du VIH. <br><br>L'ensemble des informations collectées constitue une base de données qui facilitera la mise  en place et le suivi de politiques et de programmes dans le domaine de la population et de la santé et, plus globalement, de politiques visant à l'amélioration des conditions de vie de la population nigérienne. Par ailleurs, les données ayant été collectées selon une méthodologie similaire à celle utilisée dans de nombreux autres pays ayant participé au programme DHS, celles-ci font partie, de ce fait, d'une base de données utilisable et comparable au niveau international. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>- CARACTÉRISTIQUES DES MÉNAGES : Moins d'un ménage nigérien sur dix (9 %) dispose de l'électricité et cette proportion cache des disparités importantes entre les milieux de résidence puiqu'en milieu rural, seulement 2 % des ménages possèdent l'électricité contre 47 % en milieu urbain. En outre, 22 % des ménages ont accès à l'eau de robinet ou à une borne fontaine publique. Près de deux ménages sur dix disposent de toilettes (19 %).  <br>Il ressort de l'enquête que 19 % des chefs de ménage sont des femmes. Par ailleurs, près de sept enfants de moins de 15 ans sur dix (68 %) vivent avec leurs deux parents biologiques et 10 % d'entre eux ne vivent avec aucun de leurs parents dans le ménage, que ceux-ci soient en vie ou non.  <br><br>- FÉCONDITÉ : Niveau et tendance de la fécondité. Les données de l'EDSN-MICS III montrent qu'en 2006, la fécondité des femmes nigériennes demeure encore très élevée. Avec les niveaux actuels, chaque femme donnerait naissance en moyenne à 7,1 enfants au cours de sa vie féconde. Cette fécondité est également précoce puisque 33 % des jeunes filles de moins de 20 ans ont déjà eu au moins une naissance vivante. Au Niger, 2 % seulement des femmes actuellement en union et âgées de 40 à 49 ans n'ont jamais eu d'enfant et peuvent être considérées comme stériles, cette proportion était de 5 % à l'EDSN-II de 1998. <br>Fécondité différentielle. Des différences très nettes de fécondité apparaissent entre milieux de résidence : le milieu urbain a un niveau de fécondité plus faible (ISF de 6,0) que le milieu rural (ISF de 7,4). En outre, le nombre moyen d'enfants par femme varie de façon importante selon les régions ; d'un minimum de 5,3 enfants à Niamey, il dépasse 7 dans les régions de Zinder, Dosso et Maradi. Ce nombre varie également selon le niveau d'instruction des femmes puisqu'il est de 4,6 enfants par femme chez celles ayant atteint le niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus contre 7,3 chez celles sans niveau d'instruction. Enfin les résultats montrent des écarts importants en fonction du niveau de vie du ménage dans lequel vivent les femmes : de 6,2 enfants en moyenne pour les femmes appartenant aux ménages les plus riches, ce nombre moyen passe à 8,0 pour celles des ménages les plus pauvres. <br><br>- NUPTIALITÉ : Parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans, 86 % étaient en union au moment de l'enquête. La proportion de femmes qui étaient encore célibataires à 35-39 ans est de seulement 0,2 %. Ainsi, le mariage qui demeure le cadre privilégié de l'activité sexuelle (96 % des femmes célibataires n'ont jamais eu de rapports sexuels) et de la procréation est pratiquement universel au Niger. En outre, la pratique de la polygamie est assez répandue ; près de quatre femmes sur dix (36 %) vivent en union polygame.  <br>L'entrée en union demeure précoce : 80 % des femmes de 25-49 ans étaient déjà en union avant d'atteindre 18 ans exact et la moitié des femmes entrent en première union dès l'âge de 15,5 ans. En 1998, les valeurs correspondantes étaient respectivement de 87 % et 15,1 ans chez les femmes du même groupe d'âges. Les premiers rapports sexuels se produisent également tôt et sont essentiellement déterminés par l'entrée en union ; 35 % des femmes de 25-49 ans avaient déjà eu leurs premiers rapports sexuels avant d'atteindre 15 ans exact et la moitié ont eu leurs premiers rapprts sexuels à 15,6 ans. En 1998 (EDSN­II), les valeurs correspondantes étaient de 47 % et 15,1 ans chez les femmes du même groupe d'âges. <br>Les hommes contractent leur première union à un âge beaucoup plus tardif ; l'âge médian à la première union des hommes de 30-59 ans étant de 23,1 ans. Quant à l'âge aux premiers rapports sexuels il est estimé, pour les hommes âgés de 25-59 ans, à 22,1 ans, ce qui signifie que, contrairement aux femmes, les hommes commencent leur vie sexuelle avant d'entrer en première union. <br><br>- PLANIFICATION FAMILIALE Connaissance des méthodes contraceptives. Bien que la connaissance des méthodes contra­ceptives soit répandue (68 % connaissent au moins une méthode moderne), peu de femmes les utilisent.  <br>Prévalence contraceptive. En effet, le taux de prévalence contraceptive chez les femmes en union est de seulement 11 %, toutes méthodes confondues, et de 5 % pour les méthodes modernes. On ne constate aucun changement du niveau de la prévalence contraceptive moderne parmi les femmes en union depuis 1998. En outre, l'utilisation des méthodes modernes de contraception reste limitée à certains groupes : les femmes urbaines (18 % contre 3 % en milieu rural), celles résidant dans les régions de Niamey (23 %), d'Agadez (10 %) et de Dosso (6 %) et les femmes ayant un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus (29 %). <br>Utilisation future de la contraception : Bien que l'utilisation actuelle de la contraception soit très faible, les besoins en matière de planification familiale sont relativement importants. En effet, 16 % des femmes en ont exprimé le besoin ; ces besoins sont essentiellement orientés vers l'espacement des naissances (13 %). Actuellement, 42 % de la demande potentielle totale en planification familiale chez les femmes se trouve satisfaite au Niger parmi les femmes en union.  <br><br>- SANTÉ DE LA MÈRE : Soins prénatals. En ce qui concerne les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouche­ment, on constate que pour moins de la moitié des naissances survenues dans les 5 années ayant précédé l'enquête (46 %), les mères ont effectué au moins une visite prénatale auprès de person­nel formé et dans 15 % des cas, elles en ont effectué au moins quatre.  <br>qualifié, est passée de 30 % à 40 % en 1998, date de la deuxième EDSN pour atteindre 46 % à l'EDSN­MICS III de 2006. En ce qui concerne la vaccination antitétanique,on constate que la couverture s'est nettement améliorée dans la mesure où la proportion de femmes ayant reçu une dose de vaccin antitétanique est passée de 9 % en 1992, à 16 % en 1998 et à 18 % en 2006. <br><br>- SANTÉ DE L'ENFANT : Pour la même période, seulement 18 % des femmes ont reçu une dose de vaccin antitétanique au cours de leur dernière grossesse. Ces femmes sont protégées contre le tétanos néonatal si elles avaient été vaccinées précédem­ment. Par contre, celles qui ont reçu au moins deux doses de vaccin (23 %) sont, elles et leurs nouveaux-nés, complètement protégés.  <br>Plus de huit naissances sur dix survenues au cours des cinq denières années ayant précédé l'enquête, se sont déroulées à la maison (82 %). Cette proprotion est particulièrement élevée en milieu rural (92 %), dans les régions de Tillaberi (89 %) et de Zinder (88 %). De même, 87 % des femmes sans instruction contre 60 % de celles ayant un niveau primaire et 19 % de celles ayant un niveau au moins secondaire ont accouché à domicile. En outre, les résultats montrent que parmi les femmes n'ayant reçu aucun soin prénatal et parmi celles du quintile le plus pauvre, la quasi-totalité (respectivement 97 % et 95 %) a accouché à la maison. Il faut souligner que même dans la capitale, un accouchement sur quatre (25 %) survient à domicile. <br>Globalement, seulement 17 % des femmes ont accouché dans un établissement de santé, essentiellement un établissement du secteur public. En milieu urbain, pour plus des deux tiers des naissances, les femmes ont accouché dans un établissement de santé du secteur public (67 %), et seulement 2 % dans un établissement privé. <br>Tendances des soins prénatals. La comparaison des résultats des différentes enquêtes montre que depuis 1992, date de la première EDSN, la proportion de femmes ayant effectué une visite prénatale auprès de personnel <br><br>- POSSESSION ET UTILISATION DES MOUSTIQUAIRES : On constate, d'une manière générale, que 15 % des enfants de moins de cinq ans ont dormi sous une moustiquaire la nuit ayant précédé l'enquête. La fréquence d'utilisation de la moustiquaire n'est pas influencée par l'âge de l'enfant. On ne relève aucune différence selon le sexe de l'enfant. <br>Globalement, 14 % de l'ensemble des femmes de 15-49 ans ont dormi sous une moustiquaire la nuit ayant précédé l'enquête. Cette proportion est plus faible en milieu rural (11 %) qu'en milieu urbain (28 %) et elle varie de manière importante selon le niveau d'instruction (de 13 % chez les femmes sans instruction à 20 % chez celles ayant le niveau primaire et à 24 % chez celles ayant le niveau secondaire ou plus).En outre, la proprotion de femmes enceintes ayant dormi sous une moustiquaire n'est pas très différente de celle de l'ensemble des femmes (13 % contre 14 %). <br><br>- NUTRITION : Allaitement des enfants. La quasi-totalité des enfants (98 %) ont été allaités et cette pratique est très courante quelles que soient les caractéristiques de la mère. Parmi les enfants allaités, la proportion de ceux qui ont été allaités dans l'heure qui a suivi immédiatement la naissance est de 48 % ; en ce qui concerne la proportion de ceux qui ont été allaités le jour qui a suivi la naissance, on constate qu'elle est de 64 %. Par ailleurs, seulement 14 % des enfants de moins de 6 mois sont exclusivement allaités au sein. <br>Sevrage et aliments de complément. À partir de 6 mois, tous les enfants devraient recevoir une alimentation de complément, car à partir de cet âge, le lait maternel seul n'est plus suffisant pour assurer la croissance optimale de l'enfant. À 6-7 mois, une proportion relativement importante d'enfants consomme, en plus du lait maternel, des aliments solides ou semi-solides suffisamment variés et riches en protéines et en minéraux : 24 % consomment des aliments pour bébé, 46 % des céréales, 11 % des fruits et/ou légumes, 5% des tubercules mais seulement 5 % de la viande, de la volaille, du poisson et/ou des oeufs. <br><br>- MORTALITÉ INFANTILE : Niveau de mortalité. La mortalité infantile reste élevée au plan national. Pour la période la plus récente (0-4 ans avant l'enquête), les résultats montrent que sur 1000 naissances vivantes, 81 meurent avant d'atteindre leur premier anniversaire. Bien que le niveau de la mortalité infantile enregistré aujourd'hui au Niger se situe parmi les niveaux les plus élevés au monde, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'il a diminué régulièrement depuis quinze ans. On note que globalement, de 1994 (année centrale de la période 10-14 ans avant l'enquête, à 2004 (année centrale de la période 0-4 ans avant l'enquête), la mortalité infantile est passée de 115 ‰ à 81 ‰., soit une baisse de 30 % ; et au cours de la même période, la mortalité juvénile a diminué de manière rapide (29 % de baisse).  <br><br>- MORTALITÉ MATERNELLE : Pour la période 0-9 ans avant l'enquête, soit 1997-2006, le taux de mortalité maternelle est estimé à 648 décès maternels pour 100000 naissances vivantes. Ce niveau n'aurait pratiquement pas varié depuis l'EDSN de 1992. En effet, pour la période de 1979-1992, soit 0-13 ans avant l'EDSN de 1992, le taux était estimé à 652 pour 100000 naissances.  <br><br>- EXCISION : Prévalence. La pratique de l'excision est faiblement répandue au Niger puisque qu'elle ne concerne que 2 % des femmes de 15-49 ans. La pratique de l'excision est essentiellement déterminée par l'appartenance ethnique et la région de résidence. C'est dans les ethnies Gourmantché (66 %) et Peul (13 %) et dans la région de Tillabéri (12 %) que la prévalence de l'excision est la plus forte. <br>Perspectives. Moins de 1 % des femmes enquêtées, ayant au moins une fille, avaient déjà fait exciser leur fille ou au moins l'une de leurs filles et 0,3 % avaient l'intention de la (ou les) faire exciser. <br>La quasi-totalité des femmes et des hommes (respectivement 89 % et 86 %) se sont déclarées en faveur de la disparition de cette pratique. De plus, seulement 4 % des femmes et 7 % des hommes pensent que l'excision est exigée par la religion. <br><br>- SIDA ET AUTRES IST : Connaissance du sida. Le VIH/sida est connu par pratiquement toute la population (83 % des femmes et 95 % des hommes).  <br>La limitation des rapports sexuels à un seul partenaire fidèle et non infecté ainsi que l'utilisation du condom demeurent les principaux moyens de prévention de l'infection par le VIH. Plus de cinq femmes sur dix (53 %) et prés des deux tiers des hommes (65 %) ont déclaré que le recours à ces deux moyens pouvait réduire les risques de contracter le VIH/sida. <br>Un peu plus d'une femme sur dix (13 %) sait que le virus du sida peut se transmettre par l'allaitement et que le risque de transmission maternelle peut être réduit par la prise de médicaments spéciaux au cours de la grossesse.  <br><br>- PRÉVALENCE DU VIH : Taux de couverture. Les résultats de l'EDSN­MICS III indiquent que plus de huit personnes sur dix ont consenti à donner quelques gouttes de leur sang pour être testées pour le VIH. Le taux de couverture est plus élevé chez les femmes (91 %) que chez les hommes (84 %). En outre, on constate que les taux d'acceptation chez les femmes et les hommes du milieu rural sont nettement plus élevés que chez ceux du milieu urbain. Dans l'ensemble, en milieu rural, 92 % des personnes ont accepté, contre 82 % en milieu urbain. Enfin, c'est parmi les femmes de la région de Diffa (96 %) que l'on enregistre le taux de coiuverture le plus élevé et à l'opposé, parmi les hommes d'Agadez (71 %), et ceux de Niamey (75 %) que l'on enregistre le plus faible.",0049292,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Niger - Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples 2012,"La quatrième Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples au Niger (EDSNMICS IV 2012) fait suite à celle réalisée en 2006 (EDSN-MICS III). Elle porte sur un échantillon national d'environ 12 000 ménages ordinaires, avec un nombre attendu de 13 000 femmes âgées de 15 à 49 ans enquêtées avec succès. Toutes les femmes âgées de 15-49 ans vivant de façon permanente ou qui étaient présentes la nuit précédant l’enquête dans les ménages sélectionnés sont éligibles pour être enquêtées. Comme l’enquête précédente, cette enquête a pour objectif principal de recueillir des informations sur la santé des femmes et de leur jeunes enfants, sur la fécondité, la connaissance et l’utilisation des méthodes contraceptives; la mortalité maternelle et la mortalité de jeunes enfants ainsi que sur la connaissance et les attitudes vis-à-vis des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et le sida et sur la prévalence du VIH.

Niger - National Survey on Household Living Conditions and Agriculture 2014,"Niger is part of the Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) program. This program has developed a household level survey with a view to enhancing our knowledge of agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, its role in poverty reduction and the techniques for promoting efficiency and innovation in this sector. To achieve this objective, an innovative model for agricultural data collection in this region will need to be developed and implemented. To this end, activities conducted in the future will be supported by four main pillars - a multisectoral framework, institutional integration, analytical capacity building, and active dissemination.<br><br>-  First, agricultural statistical data collection must be part of an expanded and multisectoral framework that goes beyond the rural area. This will facilitate generation of the data needed to formulate effective agricultural policies throughout Niger and in the broader framework of the rural economy. <br><br>-  Second, agricultural statistical data collection must be supported by a well-adapted institutional framework suited to fostering collaboration and the integration of data sources. By supporting a multi-pronged approach to data collection, this project seeks to foster intersectoral collaboration and overcome a number of the current institutional constraints. <br><br>-  Third, national capacity building needs to be strengthened in order to enhance the reliability of the data produced and strengthen the link between the producers and users of data. This entails having the capacity to analyze data and to produce appropriate public data sets in a timely manner. The lack of analytical expertise in developing countries perpetuates weak demand for statistical data. <br><br>-  Consequently, the foregoing has a negative impact on the quality and availability of policy-related analyses. Scant dissemination of statistics and available results has compounded this problem. <br><br>In all countries where the LSMS-ISA project will be executed, the process envisioned for data collection will be a national household survey, based on models of LSMS surveys to be conducted every three years for a panel of households. The sampling method to be adopted should ensure the quality of the data, taking into account the depth/complexity of the questionnaire and panel size, while ensuring that samples are representative. <br><br>The main objectives of the ECVM/A are to: <br><br>-  Gauge the progress made with achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); <br><br>-  Facilitate the updating of the social indicators used in formulating the policies aimed at improving the living conditions of the population; <br><br>-  Provide data related to several areas that are important to Niger without conducting specific surveys on individual topics ; <br><br>-  Provide data on several important areas for Niger that are not necessarily collected in other more specific surveys.",0049283,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nicaragua - Encuesta de Demografía y Salud 1998,"La ENDESA-98 se desarrolló en el marco de la tercera fase del programa mundial de Encuestas de Demografía y Salud (DHS) con el fin de proporcionar, a quienes diseñan y administran programas de salud y planificación familiar, información actualizada para el país con representatividad departamental sobre los niveles actuales de fecundidad y mortalidad, el conocimiento y uso de métodos de planificación familiar y fuentes de obtención, la salud materno-infantil, la nutrición, el SIDA y la Violencia Doméstica como los temas más relevantes. La información obtenida en la ENDESA-98 viene a complementar otras fuentes de información como la Encuesta de Salud Familiar de 1993, la Encuesta de Medición de los Niveles de Vida de 1993, el Censo de 1995 y la Encuesta de Medición de los Niveles de Vida de 1998, para examinar tendencias en la mortalidad en la niñez, la fecundidad y el uso de la anticoncepción entre otros. <br><br>La muestra de la ENDESA-98 es probabilística, multi-etápica, estratificada y con fracciones de muestreo variables. Los datos de la ENDESA-98 se recolectaron con tres cuestionarios: uno para la información de hogares y dos cuestionarios individuales uno para recolectar información de mujeres de 15 a 49 años de edad y de sus hijos menores de 5 años y el otro dirigido a hombres de 15 a 59 años. <br><br>Se completaron en total 11,528 entrevistas de hogares, 13,634 individuales de Mujeres (se aplicó el Módulo de Relaciones en el Hogar a 8,507 mujeres en unión o alguna vez unidas) y 2,912 entrevistas de Hombres. EL levantamiento de la Encuesta tuvo lugar entre el 1 de Diciembre de 1997 y el 31 de Mayo de 1998. Los resultados se pueden analizar a diferentes niveles de desagregación geográfica: para las tres regiones naturales (Pacífico, Centro-Norte y Atlántieo), para los 15 departamentos y las dos regiones antónomas del Atlántico (RAAN y RAAS). <br><br>CARACTERISTICAS GENERALES <br><br>Nicaragua está ubicado en el centro de América, con una extensión territorial de 119,838 kilómetros cuadrados (no incluye la extensión de los lagos Cocibolca y Xolotlán), cuenta para 1998 con una población estimada de 4,806,700 habitantes. Este número de personas implica un ritmo de crecimiento de aproximadamente tres por ciento anual y con una población compuesta mayoritariamante por niños, (43 por ciento tienen menos de 15 años). La forma principal de como ocupa el territorio nacional es el de asentamientos predominantemente urbanos, no concentrado ya que el 59 por ciento de la población vive en localidades caracterizadas como urbanas, (localidades con más de mil habitantes y alguna que otra infraestructura de desarrollo social). <br><br>La distribución territorial nicaragüense históricamente se ha estudiado en tres grandes macro regiones conocidas como: Región del Pacifico, Atlántico y Central, aunque su división política territorial comprenda 15 departamentos y dos regiones antónomas, siendo en estas dos últimas donde se encuentra asentada la mayoría de la población miskita y sumo del país, por lo que hacen de éste un país multiétnico y con diversas culturas. <br><br>El hogar es la unidad familiar donde se organizan los nicaragüenses para suplir sus necesidades morales, espirituales y materiales y en un 31 por ciento de éstos tiene como jefe a una mujer asumiendo ésta las principales decisiones en el seno del hogar cuyos miembros que en promedio llegan a ser, aproximadamente 5.5 personas. De cada 100 hogares nicaragüenses, 15 tienen por lo menos un niño ""adoptado"", es decir, niño menor de quince años que no vive con sus padres naturales. <br><br>Entre la poblaci6n masculina y femenina de seis años o mås el 23 y el 22 por ciento, respectivamente, no presentan ningún nivel de educación formal siendo los máximos valores en los niños de 6 a 9 años y en los mayores de 45 años. La poblaci6n con algún nivel de educaciún primaria representa el 49 por ciento para cada sexo y los que tiene estudios de secundaria son el 21 y 24 por ciento para hombres y mujeres respectivamente, mientras que la población con educación superior es de sólo el 5 por ciento en los hombres y 4 por ciento en las mujeres. <br><br>La dotaci6n de servicios higiénico sanitario, a pesar de la importancia de los mismos, no están disponibles en todas las viviendas; por ejemplo, el 64 por ciento de las viviendas tienen agua potable a través de la red pública (tubería), un poco menos de la cuarta parte d o las viviendas eliminan en condiciones aceptables las excretas (inodoro), aunque más del cincuenta por ciento de las viviendas utilizan foso o letrina para los desechos. Otro tipo de servicio no menos importante es el de dotación de electricidad, en este caso en 70 por ciento de los hogares se alumbran por energía eléctrica. <br><br>Aproximadamente dos de cada tres hogares nicaragüenses tienen acceso a los medios de comunicación hablados. El 78 por ciento cuenta con aparato de radio y 56 por ciento con televisor. Por último, cabe destacar que en los hogares rurales, dos de cada diez no dispone de ninguno de los bienes investigados en la encuesta, (radio, plancha, abanico, cocina, televisor, refrigeradora, lavadora, aire acondicionado, teléfono). <br><br>Entre las mujeres en edad fértil prevalece la unión libre con el 33 por ciento de ellas, (el total de mujeres en estado marital estable es de 59 por ciento), casadas el 26 por ciento y el 17 por ciento están separadas, viudas o divorciadas. Por otro lado, el 16 por ciento no tienen ningún nivel edncacional, el 40 por ciento tienen algún año de estudio o prímada aprobada, 38 por ciento de estudios secundados y en el otro extremo tenemos que el 7 por ciento han aprobado algún año universitario. <br><br>PRINCIPALES RESULTADOS<br><br>FECUNDIDAD <br><br>De acuerdo con la información disponible, la fecundidad ha venido descendiendo en las tres últimas décadas, coadyuvaron a este descenso los mayores níveles de escolaridad de la población, la urbanización creciente y el mayor conocimiento y uso de métodos anticonceptivos. Tomando como referencia a la ESF-93, la fecundidad disminuyó en un 15 por ciento, se pasó de un promedio de 4.6 hijos en esa encuesta a 3.9 en la ENDESA-98, un cambio signíficativo consíderando el hecho de que ocurrió en unos cinco años. <br><br>La estructura de la fecundidad por edades responde a una cúspide temprana, las tasas más elevadas se tienen en las mujeres de 20-24 años, es evidente, por otro lado, los niveles más elevados de las tasas en el ámbito rural, con respecto al urbano. En este contexto, las mujeres del área rural tienen en promedio más de dos hij os que las urbanas (5.4 es. 3.1, respectivamente); este diferente comportamiento reproductivo tiene como consecuencia que, aunque las mujeres rurales de 15-49 años son el 35 por ciento del total, ellas aportan con el 55 por ciento de todos los nacimientos. <br><br>PLANIFICACION FAMILIAR <br><br>CONOCIMIENTO Y USO DE METODOS <br><br>El conocimiento de métodos anticonceptivos en Nicaragua está generalizado. Prácticamente todas las mujeres nicaragüenses han oído hablar de métodos modernos de regulación de la fecundidad. Los méto- dos más conocidos son las pastillas, la esterilización femenina, las inyecciones y el condón. <br>El 60 por ciento de las mujeres actualmente unidas manifestó estar usando métodos en 1998. Este nivel de uso representa un aumento importante en comparación con el nivel observado de 49 por ciento en la ESF-93. Si bien el mayor aumento entre 1993 y 1998 se registró en el uso de la esterilización al pasar del 19 al 26 por ciento (un aumento de más de un punto porcentual por año), también el uso de las inyecciones aumentó de forma considerable (de 1 a 5 por ciento). Por otro lado, el uso de las pastillas aumentó ligeramente su participación relativa en el conjunto de métodos usados, siendo usadas por cerca de un 14 por ciento de las mujeres. El uso de métodos tradicionales es mífflmo en Nicaragua. <br><br>La mayor prevalencia de uso de métodos se encuentra entre las mujeres de mayor nivel de ins- trucción y las residentes en las áreas urbanas; a nivel de departamento, sobresalen León, Rivas, y Chontales donde 65 por ciento de las mujeres usan métodos modernos. El sector público en Nicaragua, especialmente los hospitales y los centros de salud, desempeña un papel predominante en el sum'm'istro de anticonceptivos, con una cobertura de más de 60 por ciento de las usuarias actuales de métodos modernos de planificación familiar. Las farmacias constituyen la principal fuente para los llamados métodos de suministro (pfldora, inyección, condón y métodos vaginales). <br><br>LA NECESIDAD DE PLANIFICACION FAMILIAR <br><br>El uso de métodos anticonceptivos, la planificación del actual o del último embarazo, y las intenciones reproductivas relaUvas a espaciar o limitar los nacimientos, permiten una aproximación respecto a las necesidades o a la demanda de los servicios de planificación familiar. <br><br>Según la encuesta, un 15 por ciento de las mujeres unidas presentan necesidades no satisfechas de planificación familiar, casi el 60 por ciento de ellas, están proclives a limitar los nacimientos, mientras que el resto optaría por espaciarlos. Esta necesidad no satisfecha decrece con la edad, es del 27 por ciento en las adolescentes, con un componente mayoritario por espaciar (alrededor del 80 por ciento), es del 20 por ciento en 20-24 años, con un ligero predominio por espaciar, entre los 25-39 años toma valores entre 12-13 por ciento y es inferior al 10 por ciento en las mujeres unidas de 40-49 años (a partir de los 25 años, tiene un componente mayoritario, la limitación de los nacimientos). <br><br>El porcentaje correspondiente a las mujeres en unión del área mral, casi duplica al urbano (20 vs. 11, respectivamente), con un claro predominio por limitar, en vez de espaciar los nacimientos, (12 y 8 por ciento). Estas necesidades insatisfechas, alcanzan al 25-26 por ciento en la RAAN y Jinotega, siendo del 13 o menos en Estelí, Masaya, León, Nueva Segovia, Granada, Managua y Rivas y es cuatro veces superior entre las mujeres unidas sin instrucción y aquellas con educación superior (22 y cinco por ciento, respectivamente). <br><br>DEMANDA TOTAL DE PLANIFICACION FAMILIAR <br><br>La demanda total, es el resultado de sumar los porcentajes de mujeres con necesidades tanto insatisfechas como satisfechas de los servicios de planificación familiar, a ellas se agregan las mujeres embarazadas o amenorréicas, que tuvieron una falla en el método que estaban usando. Esta demanda total, alcanza al 76 por ciento del conjunto de mujeres unidas (la demanda total por limitar más que duplica a la demanda total por espaciar, 53 y 23 por ciento, respectivamente); por edad, la demanda total, que es del 68 por ciento en las mujeres unidas de 15-19 años, sube hasta el 83 en las mujeres de 30-39 y resulta de solo 55 por ciento, a los 45-49 años; a medida que aumenta la edad y las mujeres van logrando su ideal reproductivo, cobra cada vez mayor significación, la demanda total tendente a limitar los nacimientos. <br><br>Las mujeres urbanas superan a sus similares rurales en seis puntos porcentuales (79 vs. 73), siendo similar el porcentaje en la demanda total por espaciar (23 por ciento), por consiguiente, la diferencia se tiene en la demanda total por limitar los nacimientos (55 vs. 50, por ciento). En general, en los departamentos de mayor nivel de fecundidad, se presenta una demanda total más baja (RAAN y Jinotega, 69 y 64 por ciento); en los de menor fecundidad, se alcanzan valores más elevados, alrededor del 80 por ciento en Estelh León, Managua, Carazo y Rivas, el valor más alto corresponde a Chontales (82 por ciento). Estas diferencias en el nivel de la fecundidad, conducen a contrastes parecidos, cuando se observa la escolaridad de las mujeres, la menor escolaridad se asocia con una demanda total menor (68 y 75, por ciento) en las mujeres sin instrucción y con 1-3 años de primaria, hasta 80 por ciento y valores cercanos, para las mujeres con 4-6 años de primaria y con educación superior. <br><br>DETERMINANTES DE LA FECUNDIDAD <br><br>La proporcíón de las mujeres casada o unidas del área rural es del 67 por ciento del total de mujeres que se encuentran en edad fértil este porcentaje es mucho más alto que el de las mujeres urbanas, (55 por ciento); esta diferencia, posiblemente, está relacionada a la mayor participación de las mujeres rurales en las uniones consensuales, 39 por ciento contra 30 por ciento de las mujeres urbanas. <br><br>El cincuenta por ciento de las mujeres de 20 a 49 años iniciaron su primera unión a la edad de 18.2 años, (edad mediana), dicha edad coincide plenamente con la edad mediana en la primera relación sexual o inicio de la procreación. Entre las mujeres de los departamentos del centro montaña del país en un cincuenta por ciento tuvieron su primera uniún, en promedio, a los 17.5 años al contrario de las mujeres de Managua y de los departamentos del Pacífico quienes presentaron un valor arriba de los 18.5 años en la edad de iniciación de la primera unión. <br><br>PREFERENCIAS REPRODUCTIVAS <br><br>El número ideal de hijos declarados por las mujeres es inferior a tres, un hijo de diferencia con respecto a la fecundidad efectiva (comportamiento muy similar en los hombres, también un hijo menos es el número ideal). En las mujeres urbanas el ideal es algo inferior a un hijo, con respecto al promedio real de hijos tenidos, y es de más de un hijo y medio en las mujeres rurales; reducciones cercanas a los dos hijos hubieran tenido las mujeres de los departamentos de mayor nivel de fecundidad (Jinotega, la RAAN y Río San Juan). También reducciones de dos hijos hubieran experimentado las mujeres de menor nivel de escolaridad, de menor significación hubiera resultado en las mujeres con educación secundaria y cumplen con el número ideal de hijos las mujeres con educación superior. Un 41 por ciento de las mujeres y el 38 por ciento de los hombres declaran que el número ideal de hijos es dos, la cuarta parte, tanto en mujeres como en hombres, coinciden en que el número ideal de hijos es tres. De acuerdo con los resultados obtenidos, dos de cada tres nacimientos corresponden a un evento deseado, un 16 por ciento de las mujeres hubiera preferido el hijo más adelante y el 17 por ciento restante, declara que no deseaba más hijos. <br><br>MORTALIDAD INFANTIL <br><br>NIVELES Y DIFERENCIALES DE LA MORTALIDAD INFANTIL <br><br>La reducción de la mortalidad en niños menores de 1 año y menores de 5 años en el presente decenio, constituye una de las metas establecidas en la Cumbre Mundial en favor de la Infancia. Nicaragua se enmarca dentro del proceso de descenso de la mortalidad en América Latina y a pesar de una situación socio-económica no muy favorable ha sido posible disminuir en forma importante la mortalidad infantil. <br><br>Partiendo de los niveles de hace más de 20 años encontrados con la encuesta, la mortalidad infantil ha experimentado una notable reducción en sus niveles en el orden del 60 por ciento (pasando de 100.5 por mil a 40 por mil) al igual que sus componentes (y la de los menores de 5 años (sqo)), siendo la mortalidad de los niños de 1 a 4 años, como es lo esperado, la que más rápido descendió con 74 por ciento. <br><br>ALTO RIESGO REPRODUCTIVO <br><br>La ENDESA-98 permite estimar en qué medida la mortalidad en Nicaragua es sensible a los patrones reproductivos de la población, en lo que se refiere a edades extremas de la madre al nacimiento de los hijos (mujeres menores de 18 y de 34 a más años), intervalos cortos entre nacimientos (menos de 24 meses), y orden de nacimiento mayor de 3. <br><br>El mayor riesgo lo constituye el de orden de nacimiento mayor a 3 con 19porciento. Los niños que además de ser hij os de mujeres con menos de 18 años, nacieron después de un intervalo intergenésico inferior a 24 meses tienen una probabilidad de morir, tres veces mayor que la de aquellos nacidos en categorías fuera de riesgo. En el caso de los hÖos de mujeres mayores de 34 años y que están precedidos por un intervalo menor de 24 meses y además pertenecen a un orden de nacimiento superior a 3, la probabilidad de morir es 2.5 veces mayor. <br><br>SALUD MATERNO - INFANTIL <br><br>ASISTENCIA PRENATAL Y AL PARTO <br><br>El 81 por ciento de los nacimientos vivos en los últimos cinco años contaron con atención prenatal por personal calificado y el 65 por ciento tuvieron asistencia calificada en el parto. En ambos casos, menos de un cuarto de la asistencia fue obtenida de un ginecólogo u obstetra. En el 12 por ciento de esos nacímientos, sus madres no recibieron nínguna dosís antítetáníca, aunque sólo un 64 por cíento nacieron en instituciones de salud, estos últimos ocurrieron especialmente en las áreas rurales. Según los datos de la ESF-93, se han alcanzado mayores coberturas de estos servicios. <br><br>Según la declaraci6n de la madre, 9 por ciento de los niños pesaron menos de 2500 gramos, pero el 30 por ciento consideraron que sus hijos fueron pequeños o más pequeños que el promedio. Más de la mitad (58 por ciento) tuvieron parto normal, 28 por ciento se enfrentaron a un trabajo de parto prolongado y 28 por ciento sufrieron sangrado excesivo, las infecciones vaginales se le presentaron al 8 por ciento de las madres y 3 por ciento convulsionaron. Las proporciones de infecciones vaginales y convulsiones se presentan mas altas en las madres de los niños que murieron después del nacimiento. Un 15 por ciento de los partos se realizaron con operaci6n cesárea, principalmente en el Managua (25 por ciento) y entre las mujeres de mayor instmcci6n (45 por ciento). <br><br>VACUNARION <br><br>Entre los niños de 12 a 23 meses se observa que el 72 por ciento han sido totalmente inmunizados. El 95 por ciento recibió la vacuna contra la tuberculosis (BCG), 80 por ciento tiene las tres dosis de DPT y 83 por ciento las tres dosis de antipolio y el 86 por ciento, la antisarampionosa. El 56 por ciento de esos niños habían recibido su esquema completo en el primer año de edad. El 25 por ciento de los niños, tienen un esquema incompleto de vacunación y 2 por ciento no tienen ninguna. <br><br>INFECCIONES RESPIRATORIAS AGUDAS (IRA) <br><br>Uno de cada cuatro niños menores de cinco años tuvo infecci6n respiratoria aguda durante las dos semanas anteriores a la encuesta y 23 por ciento presentaron fiebre. El 58 por ciento de los niños con IRA fueron llevados a una instimci6n de salud. Las IRA's afectan mayormente los grupos menos favorecidos de la población, esto es los hijos de madres con bajo o ningún nivel de instrucción. Los niños de 2 años fueron particularmente afectados (33 por ciento). <br><br>ENFERMEDADES DIARREICAS AGUDAS (EDA) Y REHIDRATACION ORAL <br><br>Los niños que tuvieron enfermedades diarréicas agudas, durante las dos semanas anteriores a la encuesta, fueron el 14 por ciento, porcentaje menor al encontrado por la ESF-93 (17 por ciento). Los niños de seis a once meses de edad tuvieron la más alta prevalencia (24 por ciento). <br><br>LACTANCIA <br><br>La lactancia es una práctica generalizada en Nicaragua, pero disminuye rápidamente con la edad del niño. A casi cuatro de cada cinco niños se les dio leche materna durante la primera hora. El promedio de meses de lactancia entre los niños menores de tres años es de 15 meses y de la lactancia exclusiva 2. I meses. Aunque la mitad de los niños, lactan menos de 12 meses y toman exclusivamente leche materna, menos de 2l días. <br><br>NUTRICION DE LOS NIÑOS <br><br>Entre los menores de cinco años 25 por ciento (9 por ciento severa) sufren de desnutrición crónica o retardo en el crecimiento (corta talla para la edad), alrededor del 2 por ciento sufre de desnutrición aguda o emaciación (adelgazamiento exagerado para la estatura) y el 12 por ciento sufre de desnutrición global o bajo peso para la edad. <br><br>El problema de Nicaragua es la desnutrición crónica, que se ha extendido desde 1993 (la EMNV-93 encontró a un cuarto de los niños en esta condición). A partir de los seis meses, el porcentaje de desnutridos aumenta, llegando al 30 por ciento entre los niños de un año de edad. El porcentaje de niños varones supera el de las niñas en 4 puntos porcentuales, del área rural casi dobla al de la urbana y el de los hijos de mujeres sin instrucción quintuplica el de los hijos de mujeres instmidas. <br><br>NUTRICION DE LAS MUJERES <br><br>Las mujeres nicaragüenses de 15 a 49 años tienen en promedio corta estatura (154.1 cm.) y sobrepeso (IMC=24.9). No presentan mucho problema de desnutrici6n (4 por ciento de desnutridas), salvo entre las mujeres sin hijos, que son en general las más jóvenes (8 por ciento). Por el contrario, el porcentaje de obesas asciende a 14 por ciento y éste se eleva a un 25 por ciento, entre las mujeres de 35 años y más. <br><br>CONOCIMIENTOS SOBRE EL SIDA <br><br>Debido a las campañas que se estuvieron pasando hace algún tiempo por la radio y por la televisi6n nicaragüense, muchas personas han oído hablar del Síndrome de Inmuno Deficiencia Adquirida o SIDA; sin embargo, ésto no garantiza que los contenidos de la campaña le lleguen con claridad a toda la gente. Todavía hay mujeres que no saben que algunas personas que parecen saludables pueden tener el virus del VIH, o que el SIDA es una enfermedad fatal. Pese a ello, casi seis de cada diez mujeres saben que se puede evitar usando el condón y una cuarta parte piensa que se evita teniendo un solo compañero sexual. Estos valores son similares a las respuestas dadas por los hombres, 65 y 22 por ciento respectivamente. <br><br>Nueve por ciento de las mujeres cree que sus riesgos de contraer la enfermedad son grandes y 6 por ciento reconoció una probabilidad moderada. Sin embargo, son los hombres quienes creen tener mayor riesgo de contraer el SIDA (20 y 11 por ciento respectivamente). Con todo esto, 75 por ciento de los hombres y 41 por ciento de las mujeres han cambiado su comportamiento sexual desde que ellos escucharon por primera vez del SIDA. <br><br>VIOLENCIA DOMESTICA <br><br>Los resultados de la ENDESA-98 indican que 29 por ciento de las mujeres alguna vez en unión han recibido algún maltrato físico o sexual. La prevalencia de abuso físico y sexual es mayor entre las mujeres del área urbana, de menor nivel educativo, y con un mayor número de hijos vivos. De las mujeres que reportaron algún abuso ffsico en su vida, 43 por ciento indicaron que estos episodios sucedieron durante los últimos 12 meses. De igual manera, en el 57 por ciento de los casos de mujeres con abuso físico o sexual, sus hijos estaban presentes y a otro 36 por ciento de esta mujeres el abuso sucedió mientras estaban embarazadas.",0049271,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nicaragua - Rice and Banana Farmers 2010-2011,"This report is an impact evaluation of two components of the Rural Business Development Program (RBD) in Nicaragua, specifically the components benefitting rice and plantain farmers on Nicaragua’s Pacific coast. The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).<br><br>Key results of the evaluation are: <br>-Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program. <br>-The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan. <br>-No ERR was estimated for the input/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios. <br>-While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero. <br>-Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades). <br>-The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program. <br>-I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program. <br>-The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years. <br>-The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries).",0049259,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nepal - Family Health Survey 1996,"The 1996 Nepal Family Health Survey (NFHS) is a nationally representative survey of 8,429 ever- married women age 15-49. The survey is the fifth in a series of demographic and health surveys conducted in Nepal since 1976. The main purpose of the NFHS was to provide detailed information on fertility, family planning, infant and child mortality, and matemal and child health and nutrition. In addition, the NFHS included a series of questions on knowledge of AIDS. <br><br>The primary objective of the Nepal Family Health Survey (NFHS) is to provide national level estimates of fertility and child mortality. The survey also provides information on nuptiality, contraceptive knowledge and behaviour, the potential demand for contraception, other proximate determinants of fertility, family size preferences, utilization of antenatal services, breastfeeding and food supplementation practices, child nutrition and health, immunizations, and knowledge about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This information will assist policy-makers, administrators and researchers to assess and evaluate population and health programmes and strategies. The NFHS is comparable to Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in other developing countries. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Survey results indicate that fertility in Nepal has declined steadily from over 6 births per woman in the mid-1970s to 4.6 births per woman during the period of 1994-1996. Differentials in fertility by place of residence are marked, with the total fertility rate (TFR) for urban Nepal (2.9 births per woman) about two children less than for rural Nepal (4.8 births per woman). The TFR in the Mountains (5.6 births per woman) is about one child higher than the TFR in the Hills and Terai (4.5 and 4.6 births per woman, respectively). By development region, the highest TFR is observed in the Mid-western region (5.5 births per woman) and the lowest TFR in the Eastern region (4.1 births per woman). <br><br>Fertility decline in Nepal has been influenced in part by a steady increase in age at marriage over the past 25 years. The median age at first marriage has risen from 15.5 years among women age 45-49 to 17.1 years among women age 20-24. This trend towards later marriage is supported by the fact that the proportion of women married by age 15 has declined from 41 percent among women age 45-49 to 14 percent among women age 15-19. There is a strong relationship between female education and age at marriage. The median age at first marriage for women with no formal education is 16 years, compared with 19.8 years for women with some secondary education. <br><br>Despite the trend towards later age at marriage, childbearing begins early for many Nepalese women. One in four women age 15-19 is already a mother or pregnant with her first child, with teenage childbearing more common among rural women (24 percent) than urban women (20 percent). Nearly one in three adolescent women residing in the Terai has begun childbearing, compared with one in five living in the Mountains and 17 percent living in the Hills. Regionally, the highest level of adolescent childbearing is observed in the Central development region while the lowest is found in the Western region. <br><br>Short birth intervals are also common in Nepal, with one in four births occurring within 24 months of a previous birth. This is partly due to the relatively short period of insusceptibility, which averages 14 months, during which women are not exposed to the risk of pregnancy either because they are amenorrhoeic or abstaining. By 12-13 months after a birth, mothers of the majority of births (57 percent) are susceptible to the risk of pregnancy. Early childbearing and short birth intervals remain a challenge to policy-makers. NFHS data show that children born to young mothers and those born after short birth intervals suffer higher rates of morbidity and mortality. <br><br>Despite the decline in fertility, Nepalese women continue to have more children than they consider ideal. At current fertility levels, the average woman in Nepal is having almost 60 percent more births than she wants--the total wanted fertility rate is 2.9 births per woman, compared with the actual total fertility rate of 4.6 births per woman. Unplanned and unwanted births are often associated with increased mortality risks. More than half(56 percent) of all births in the five-year period before the survey had an increased risk of dying because <br>the mother was too young (under 18 years) or too old (more than 34 years), or the birth was of order 3 or higher, or the birth occurred within 24 months of a previous birth. <br><br>Nevertheless, the percentage of women who want to stop childbearing in Nepal has increased substantially, from 40 percent in 1981 to 52 percent in 1991 and to 59 percent in 1996. According to the NFHS, 41 percent of currently married women age 15-49 say they do not want any more children, and an additional 18 percent have been sterilized. Furthermore, 21 percent of married women want to wait at least two years for their next child and only 13 percent want to have a child soon, that is, within two years. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Knowledge of family planning is virtually universal in Nepal, with 98 percent of currently married women having heard of at least one method of family planning. This is a five-fold increase over the last two decades (1976-1996). Much of this knowledge comes from media exposure. Fifty-three percent of ever-married women had been exposed to family planning messages on the radio and/or the television and 23 percent have been exposed to messages through the print media. In addition, about one in four women has heard at least one of three specific family planning programmes on the radio. <br><br>There has been a steady increase in the level of ever use of modern contraceptive method over the past 20 years, from 4 percent of currently married women in 1976, to 27 percent in 1991 and 35 percent in 1996. Among ever-users, female sterilization and male sterilization are the most popular methods (37 percent), indicating that contraceptive methods have been used more for limiting than for spacing births. <br><br>The contraceptive prevalence rate among currently married women is 29 percent, with the majority of women using modern methods (26 percent). Again, the most widely used method is sterilization (18 percent, male and female combined), followed by injectables (5 percent). Although current use of modern contraceptive methods has risen steadily over the last two decades, the pace of change has been slowest in the most recent years (1991-1996). Current use among currently married non-pregnant women increased from 3 percent in 1976 to 15 percent in 1986 to 24 percent in 1991 and to 29 percent in 1996. While female sterilization increased by only 3 percent from 45 percent of modern methods in 1986 to 46 percent in 1996, male sterilization declined by almost 50 percent from 41 percent to 21 percent over the same period. <br><br>The level of current use is nearly twice as high in the urban areas (50 percent) as in rural areas (27 percent). Only 18 percent of currently married women residing in the Mountains are currently using contraception, compared with 30 percent and 29 percent living in the Hills and Terai regions, respectively. There is a notable difference in current contraceptive use between the Far-western region (21 percent) and all the other regions, especially the Central and Eastern regions (31 percent each). Educational differences in current use are large, with 26 percent of women with no education currently using contraception, compared with 52 percent of women who have completed their School Leaving Certificate (SLC). In general, as women's level of education rises, they are more likely to use modem spacing methods. <br><br>The public sector figures prominently as a source of modem contraceptives. Seventy-nine percent of modem method users obtained their methods from a public source, especially hospitals and district clinics (32 percent) and mobile camps (28 percent). The public sector is the predominant source of sterilizations, 1UDs, injectables, and Norplant, and both the public and private sectors are equally important sources of the pill and condoms. Nevertheless, the public sector's share of the market has fallen over the last five years from 93 percent of current users in 1991 to 79 percent in 1996. <br><br>There is considerable potential for increased family planning use in Nepal. Overall, one in three women has an unmet need for family planning--14 percent for spacing and 17 percent for limiting. The total demand for family planning, including those women who are currently using contraception, is 60 percent. Currently, the family planning needs of only one in two women is being met. While the increase in unmet need between 1991 (28 percent) and 1996 (31 percent) was small, there was a 14 percent increase in the percentage of women using any method of family planning and, over the same period, a corresponding increase of 18 percent in the demand for family planning. <br><br>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH <br><br>At current mortality levels, one of every 8 children born in Nepal will die before the fifth birthday, with two of three deaths occurring during the first year of life. Nevertheless, NFHS data show that mortality levels have been declining rapidly in Nepal since the eighties. Under-five mortality in the period 0-4 years before the survey is 40 percent lower than it was 10-14 years before the survey, with child mortality declining faster (45 percent) than infant mortality (38 percent). <br><br>Mortality is consistently lower in urban than in rural areas, with children in the Mountains faring much worse than children living in the Hills and Terai. Mortality is also far worse in the Far-western and Mid-western development regions than in the other regions. Maternal education is strongly related to mortality, and children of highly educated mothers are least likely to die young. For example, infant mortality is nearly twice as high among children of mothers with no education as among children of mothers with some secondary education. <br><br>Neonatal mortality is expectedly higher among males than females. However, child mortality is 24 percent higher among females than males. First births, higher order births and births spaced less than 24 months apart also experience higher mortality. <br><br>Perinatal mortality in Nepal has declined by 17 percent over the last 15 years from 63 deaths per 1,000 stillbirths and live births in the period 10-14 years before the survey to 52 deaths in the period 0-4 years before the survey. First pregnancies, high order pregnancies, pregnancies to women residing in rural areas, in the Terai, and in the Eastern region, are all at an increased risk of loss. <br><br>One possible reason for the declining mortality is improvements in childhood vaccination coverage. The NFHS results show that about 76 percent of children age 12-23 months have been vaccinated against tuberculosis, DPT and polio. However, coverage declines after the first dose for DPT and polio, with one-third of children who start the series not completing it. Fifty-seven percent of children age 12-23 months were vaccinated against measles. Overall, two of five children had all the recommended vaccinations, and 36 percent were fully vaccinated before their first birthday. <br><br>Diarrhoeal and respiratory illnesses are common causes of child deaths in Nepal. In the two weeks before the survey, 28 percent of children suffered from diarrhoea and 34 percent were ill with acute respiratory infections (AR1). However, use of health facilities is low in Nepal: only 14 percent of children with diarrhoea and 18 percent of children with ARI were taken to a health facility. Solution prepared from oral rehydration salts (ORS) was given to 26 percent of children with diarrhoea, and 4 percent received recommended home fluids (RHF). In addition, 35 percent of children with diarrhoea were given more to drink than before the diarrhoea. Over one-third of children with diarrhoea received no treatment at all. <br><br>The care that a woman receives daring pregnancy and childbirth reduces the risk of illness and death for both mother and child. The NFHS data show that mothers received antenatal care from a doctor for only 13 percent of births in the three years preceding the survey, and from a nurse/midwife for I 1 percent of births. One of two women who received some antenatal care had fewer than 3 visits. For the majority of births (56 percent), mothers did not receive any antenatal care. <br><br>An important component of antenatal care is protection against tetanus. Two or more doses of tetanus toxoid vaccines were received by mothers for about one-third of births, while 13 percent received one dose. For well over half of births, mothers did not receive a single dose. <br><br>The majority of Nepalese children are born at home without assistance from trained medical personnel. Overall, only 8 percent of births are delivered in a health facility and 9 percent are delivered under the supervision of a doctor or nurse/midwife. <br><br>Breastfeeding is nearly universal in Nepal and the average length of time that children are breastfed is relatively long (28 months). However, a significant minority of children (40 percent) are not breastfed within one day of birth. Bottle feeding is relatively rare in Nepal and less than 3 percent of children under three years of age were fed with a bottle using a nipple. Even though exclusive breastfeeding is recommended until 4-6 months of age, one-third of children age 4-5 months receive complementary foods. <br><br>There is considerable malnutrition among children in Nepal. Forty-eight percent of children under age three are stunted, 11 percent are wasted, and 47 percent are underweight. Variation by place of residence is marked, with rural children, children living in the Mountains and in the Far-western regions of Nepal more likely to be malnourished than other children. <br><br>Maternal nutritional status was also assessed from the NFHS data. Fit~een percent of Nepalese mothers of children born during the three years before the survey were less than 145 centimetres tall, the height below which a woman is considered to be at nutritional risk. Furthermore, more than one of four women fell below the cutoff of 18.5 for body mass index, which measures thinness, indicating that the level of chronic energy deficiency in Nepal is relatively high. Maternal deaths are high relative to developed countries. According to the NFHS data, maternal deaths accounted for 27 percent of all deaths to women age 15-49, with a maternal mortality ratio of 5 deaths per 1,000 live births.",0049236,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Nepal - Demographic and Health Survey 2001,"The 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Sur­vey (NDHS) is a nationally representative sur­vey of 8,726 women age 15-49 and 2,261 men age 15-59. This Survey is the sixth in a series of national-level population and health surveys conducted in Nepal.  It is the second nationally representative comprehensive survey conducted as part of the global Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) pro­gram, the first being the 1996 Nepal Family Health Survey (NFHS). The 2001 NDHS is the first in the history of demographic and health surveys conducted in Nepal that included a male sample. The 2001 NDHS was carried out under the aegis of the Family Health Division of the Department of Health Services, Ministry of Health, and was implemented by New ERA, a local research organiza­tion, which also conducted the 1996 NFHS.

Nepal - The Role of Information and Cash Transfers on Early Childhood Development 2013-2014,"While substantial progress has been made in combating malnutrition at a global level, chronic maternal and child malnutrition remains a serious problem in many parts of the developing world. In this paper, using a randomized control trial design in Nepal, we evaluate a program that provided information on best practices about maternal and child health and nutrition, and cash to families in extremely poor areas with pregnant mothers and/or children below the age of 2. We find significant and sizable impacts of the information plus cash intervention on maternal knowledge, behavior, child development, and nutrition. The size of these impacts along some measures of knowledge and development are significantly different from the information only intervention group suggesting a potential role for providing a short term cash safety net along with information to tackle the problem of malnutrition.",0049216,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

In the 2006-07 NDHS, 98 percent of all women reported know­ing about a contraceptive method. Male con­doms, injectables, and the pill are the most wide­ly known methods. <br><br>Child health : Data from the 2006-07 NDHS indicate that the under-five mortality rate in Namibia is 69 deaths per 1,000 live births (based on the five-year pe­riod preceding the survey). <br><br>Maternal health : In Namibia, almost all women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey re­ceived antenatal care from health professionals (95 percent): 16 percent from a doctor and 79 percent from a nurse or midwife. Only 4 percent of mothers did not receive any antenatal care. <br><br>Breastfeeding and nutrition : Breastfeeding is common in Namibia, with 94 percent of children breastfed at some point dur­ing childhood. The median breastfeeding dura­tion in Namibia is 16.8 months. <br><br>Malaria: One in four households interviewed in the survey has at least one mosquito net, and most of these households have a net that has been treated at some time with an insecticide (20 percent). <br><br>HIV/AIDS and STIS : Knowledge of HIV and AIDS is universal in Namibia; 99 percent of women age 15-49 and 99 percent of men age 15-49 have heard of AIDS. <br><br>Orphans and vulnerable children : One-quarter of Namibian children under age 18 in the households sampled for the 2006-07 NDHS live with both parents, while one in three does not live with either parent. Seventeen per­cent of children under age 18 are orphaned, that is, one or both parents is dead.<br><br>Access to health facilities : Households interviewed in the 2006-07 NDHS were asked to name the nearest government health facility, the mode of transport they would use to visit the facility, and how long it takes to get to the facility using the transport of choice.",0049190,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Moldova - Demographic and Health Survey 2005,"Moldova's first Demographic and Health Survey (2005 MDHS) is a nationally representa­tive sample survey of 7,440 women age 15-49 and 2,508 men age 15-59 selected from 400 sample points (clusters) throughout Moldova (excluding the Transnistria region). It is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Moldova; it includes several indicators which follow up on those from the 1997 Moldova Repro­ductive Health Survey (1997 MRHS) and the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2000 MICS). The 2005 MDHS used a two-stage sample based on the 2004 Population and Housing Census and was designed to produce separate estimates for key indicators for each of the major regions in Moldova, including the North, Center, and South regions and Chisinau Municipality. Unlike the 1997 MRHS and the 2000 MICS surveys, the 2005 MDHS did not cover the region of Transnis­tria. Data collection took place over a two-month period, from June 13 to August 18, 2005.  <br><br>The survey obtained detailed information on fertility levels, abortion levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women and young children, childhood mortality, maternal and child health, adult health, and awareness and behavior regard­ing HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. Hemoglobin testing was conducted on women and children to detect the presence of anemia. Additional features of the 2005 MDHS include the collection of information on interna­tional emigration, language preference for reading printed media, and domestic violence. <br>The 2005 MDHS was carried out by the National Scientific and Applied Center for Preventive Medicine, hereafter called the National Center for Preventive Medicine (NCPM), of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. ORC Macro provided technical assistance for the MDHS through the USAID-funded MEASURE DHS project. Local costs of the survey were also supported by USAID, with additional funds from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and in-kind contributions from the NCPM. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS <br><br>Ethnicity and Religion. Most women and men in Moldova are of Moldovan ethnicity (77 percent and 76 percent, respectively), followed by Ukrainian (8-9 percent of women and men), Rus­sian (6 percent of women and men), and Gagauzan (4-5 percent of women and men). Romanian and Bulgarian ethnicities account for 2 to 3 percent of women and men. The overwhelming majority of Moldovans, about 95 percent, report Orthodox Christianity as their religion.<br><br>Residence and Age. The majority of respondents, about 58 percent, live in rural areas. For both sexes, there are proportionally more respondents in age groups 15-19 and 45-49 (and also 45-54 for men), whereas the proportion of respondents in age groups 25-44 is relatively lower. This U-shaped age distribution reflects the aging baby boom cohort following World War II (the youngest of the baby boomers are now in their mid-40s), and their children who are now mostly in their teens and 20s. The smaller proportion of men and women in the middle age groups reflects the smaller cohorts following the baby boom gen­eration and those preceding the generation of baby boomers' children. To some degree, it also reflects the disproportionately higher emigration of the working-age population. <br><br>Education. Women and men in Moldova are universally well educated, with virtually 100 percent having at least some secondary or higher education; 79 percent of women and 83 percent of men have only a secondary or secondary special education, and the remainder pursues a higher education. More women (21 percent) than men (16 percent) pursue higher education. <br><br>Language Preference. Among women, preferences for language of reading material are about equal for Moldovan (37 percent) and Rus­sian (35 percent) languages. Among men, prefer­ence for Russian (39 percent) is higher than for Moldovan (25 percent). A substantial percentage of women and men prefer Moldovan and Russian equally (27 percent of women and 32 percent of men).<br><br>Living Conditions. Access to electricity is almost universal for households in Moldova. Ninety percent of the population has access to safe drinking water, with 86 percent in rural areas and 96 percent in urban areas. Seventy-seven percent of households in Moldova have adequate means of sanitary disposal, with 91 percent of households in urban areas and only 67 percent in rural areas.  <br><br>Children's Living Arrangements. Com­pared with other countries in the region, Moldova has the highest proportion of children who do not live with their mother and/or father. Only about two-thirds (69 percent) of children under age 15 live with both parents. Fifteen percent live with just their mother although their father is alive, 5 percent live with just their father although their mother is alive, and 7 percent live with neither parent although they are both alive. Compared with living arrangements of children in 2000, the situation appears to have worsened. <br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Levels and Trends. The total fer­tility rate (TFR) in Moldova is 1.7 births. This means that, on average, a woman in Moldova will give birth to 1.7 children by the end of her repro­ductive period. Overall, fertility rates have de­clined since independence in 1991. However, data indicate that fertility rates may have increased in recent years. For example, women of childbearing age have given birth to, on average, 1.4 children at the end of their childbearing years. This is slightly less than the total fertility rate (1.7), with the dif­ference indicating that fertility in the past three years is slightly higher than the accumulation of births over the past 30 years.  <br><br>Fertility Differentials. The TFR for rural areas (1.8 births) is higher than that for urban areas (1.5 births). Results show that this urban-rural dif­ference in childbearing rates can be attributed almost exclusively to younger age groups. <br> <br>CONTRACEPTION <br><br>Knowledge of Contraception. Knowledge of family planning is nearly universal, with 99 per­cent of all women age 15-49 knowing at least one modern method of family planning. Among all women, the male condom, IUD, pills, and with­drawal are the most widely known methods of family planning, with over 80 percent of all women saying they have heard of these methods. Female sterilization is known by two-thirds of women, while periodic abstinence (rhythm meth­od) is recognized by almost six in ten women. Just over half of women have heard of the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), while 40-50 percent of all women have heard of injectables, male ster­ilization, and foam/jelly. The least widely known methods are emergency contraception, diaphragm, and implants. <br><br>Use of Contraception. Sixty-eight percent of currently married women are using a family planning method to delay or stop childbearing. Most are using a modern method (44 percent of married women), while 24 percent use a traditional method of contraception. The IUD is the most widely used of the modern methods, being used by 25 percent of married women. The next most widely used method is withdrawal, used by 20 percent of married women. Male condoms are used by about 7 percent of women, especially younger women. Five percent of married women have been sterilized and 4 percent each are using the pill and periodic abstinence (rhythm method). <br>The results show that Moldovan women are adopting family planning at lower parities (i.e., when they have fewer children) than in the past. Among younger women (age 20-24), almost half (49 percent) used contraception before having any children, compared with only 12 percent of women age 45-49. <br>  <br>MATERNAL HEALTH <br><br>Antenatal Care and Delivery Care. Among women with a birth in the five years pre­ceding the survey, almost all reported seeing a health professional at least once for antenatal care during their last pregnancy; nine in ten reported 4 or more antenatal care visits. Seven in ten women had their first antenatal care visit in the first trimester.  In addition, virtually all births were deliv­ered by a health professional, in a health facility. Results also show that the vast majority of women have timely checkups after delivering; 89 percent of all women received a medical checkup within two days of the birth, and another 6 percent within six weeks. <br><br>CHILD HEALTH<br><br>Childhood Mortality. The infant mortality rate for the 5-year period preceding the survey is 13 deaths per 1,000 live births, meaning that about 1 in 76 infants dies before the first birthday. The under-five mortality rate is almost the same with 14 deaths per 1,000 births. The near parity of these rates indicates that most all early childhood deaths take place during the first year of life. Comparison with official estimates of IMRs suggests that this rate has been improving over the past decade. <br><br>NUTRITION<br><br>Breastfeeding Practices. Breastfeeding is nearly universal in Moldova: 97 percent of chil­dren are breastfed. However the duration of breast-feeding is not long, exclusive breastfeeding is not widely practiced, and bottle-feeding is not un­common. In terms of the duration of breastfeeding, data show that by age 12-15 months, well over half of children (59 percent) are no longer being breastfed. By age 20-23 months, almost all chil­dren have been weaned. <br><br>Exclusive breastfeeding is not widely prac­ticed and supplementary feeding begins early: 57 percent of breastfed children less than 4 months are exclusively breastfed, and 46 percent under six months are exclusively breastfeed. The remaining breastfed children also consume plain water, wa­ter-based liquids or juice, other milk in addition to breast milk, and complimentary foods. <br>Bottle-feeding is fairly widespread in Mol­dova; almost one-third (29 percent) of infants un­der 4 months old are fed with a bottle with a nip­ple. <br><br>Nutritional Status of Children. At the na­tional level, about 8 percent of children under age five are stunted (low height-for-age), while about 4 percent of children are wasted (low weight-for­height), and 4 percent are underweight (low weight-for-age). <br><br>HIV/AIDS KNOWLEDGE<br><br>Awareness of HIV/AIDS. Awareness of HIV/AIDS is almost universal among persons of reproductive age. Ninety-seven percent of men and women age 15-49 have heard of HIV/AIDS, but men are slightly better informed than women about specific ways to avoid contracting the dis­ease: 81 percent of women and 89 percent of men indicate that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one faithful partner; 78 percent of women and 87 percent of men are aware that condoms can reduce the risk of contracting HIV during sexual intercourse; and 63 percent of women and 85 percent of men know that abstaining from sex reduces the chances of getting the disease. Seventy-six percent of women and 78 percent of men know that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus. <br><br>Knowledge patterns between men and women are reversed for mother-to-child transmis­sion of HIV: 68 percent of women compared with 53 percent of men know that HIV can be transmit­ted by breastfeeding; 86 percent of women and 79 percent of men know the disease can be transmit­ted from the mother to the child during pregnancy; and 82 percent of women and 76 percent of men know it can be transmitted during delivery. <br><br>HIV Testing. Thirty-six percent of women in Moldova have been tested for HIV at some time, compared with 30 percent of men. Thirty-four percent of women and 27 percent of men were tested and also received the results of their HIV test. <br><br>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE <br><br>Violence Since Age 15. MDHS data show that one-quarter of all women (27 percent) have experienced violence since they were age 15 and 13 percent experienced violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. The main perpetrators of violence against women are husbands (69 percent) and, to a lesser extent, fathers/stepfathers (14 per­cent), and mothers/stepmothers (7 percent). <br><br>Marital Violence. Twenty-three percent of ever-married women report having experienced emotional violence by husbands, 24 percent report physical violence, and 4 percent report sexual vio­lence. Almost one-third (32 percent) of ever-married women report suffering emotional, physi­cal, or sexual violence, while 3 percent have experienced all three forms of violence by their current or most recent husband. <br><br>The data further show that divorced or sepa­rated women are more than twice as likely as mar­ried women to have been abused emotionally, physically, and sexually, suggesting that the vio­lence might have been a factor in the termination of their marriages. <br><br>EMIGRATION <br><br>In Moldova, and in post-Soviet states in gen­eral, large-scale labor emigration is an important demographic phenomenon that has a substantial negative impact on the population growth as well as on the social and economic structure of society.  <br><br>Emigrant Households. Seventeen percent of households in Moldova have at least one former member who emigrated. This percentage is about the same in urban and rural households. The high­est percentage of households with at least one emigrant is in the South region (21 percent) and the lowest is in Chisinau (13 percent). <br><br>Emigrant Characteristics. A slightly high­er proportion of emigrants are males (52 percent, compared with 48 percent for women). However, in Chisinau and the South region, a slightly higher proportion of emigrants are females. The distribu­tion of emigrants by age at emigration is similar for males and females. The most common age group for emigration is age 20-24 for both sexes. This age group accounts for roughly one-quarter of all emigrants (22 percent of females and 27 per­cent of males). Approximately three-quarters of all emigrants leave the country between age 15 and 39 (73 percent of females and 79 percent of males).",0049069,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Mali - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 2001,"Le Mali a mené trois Enquêtes Démographiques et de Santé (EDSM-I, II et III) dont la première en 1987 à travers le CERPOD (Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche sur la Population et le Développement), la seconde en 1995/1996 par la Cellule de Planification et de Statistique du Ministère de la Santé, la Direction Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Informatique avec l'appui technique de ORC Macro et la troisième en 2001, sous la responsabilité technique de la Cellule de Planification et de Statistique du Ministère de la Santé, la Direction Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Informatique avec l'appui technique de ORC Macro. <br><br>Ces enquêtes périodiques ont pour but de :<br>- Fournir des informations sur la fécondité et ses déterminants, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant et la mortalité des enfants ; <br>- Apprécier les différentes tendances enregistrées de ces phénomènes et mettre à jour des données ; <br>- Constituer une base de données fiables sur la fécondité, la santé de la reproduction, la mortalité maternelle et infantile et la nutrition. <br><br>Pour la première fois, un module avec test sur l'anémie a été intégré à l'Enquête Démographique et de Santé de 2001, pour évaluer la situation nutritionnelle des enfants et des femmes enceintes. Mais la principale innovation de l'EDSM-III aura été l'intégration d'un module d'enquête de séro-prévalence du VIH/sida. Ceci a permis de tester avec succès la possibilité de mener les enquêtes de séro-prévalence sur le VIH/sida, avec un taux d'acceptation de 91 % chez les femmes et 86 % chez les hommes, ce qui constitue l'un des meilleurs taux dans la sous-région. Ceci a été rendu possible grâce à l'introduction du test d'anémie, l'existence d'une méthodologie de test rapide fiable expérimenté par le Centers for Disease Control (CDC) des Etats-Unis et surtout l'existence d'un laboratoire de biologie moléculaire à l'Institut National de Recherche en Santé Publique (INRSP) capable de mener tous les tests de contrôle du VIH/sida. <br><br>Cette troisième enquête (EDSM-III) a touché un échantillon de 12285 ménages et dans chaque ménage, toutes les femmes de 15 à 49 ans et un tiers des hommes de 15 à 59 ans ont été enquêtés.

Mali - COVID-19 Panel Phone Survey of Households 2020,"In the WAEMU countries, COVID-19 is expected to affect households in many ways. First, governments might reduce social transfers to households due to the decline in revenue arising from the potential COVID-19 economic recession. Second households deriving income from vulnerable sectors such as tourism and related activities will likely face risk of unemployment or loss of income. Third an increase in prices of imported goods can also negatively impact household welfare, as a direct consequence of the increase of these imported items or as indirect increase of prices of local good manufactured using imported inputs. In this context, there is a need to produce high frequency data to help policy makers in monitoring the channels by which the pandemic affects households and assessing its distributional impact. To do so, the sample of the longitudinal survey will be a sub-sample of the 2018/19 household survey in each country.<br><br>For Mali, the survey which is implemented by the National Statistical Office (INSTAT), is conducted using cell phone numbers of household members collected during the 2018/19 survey.

Malawi - Demographic and Health Survey 1992,"The 1992 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) was a nationally representative sample survey designed to provide information on levels and trends in fertility, early childhood mortality and morbidity, family planning knowledge and use, and maternal and child health. The survey was implemented by the National Statistical Office during September to November 1992. In 5323 households, 4849 women age 15-49 years and 1151 men age 20-54 years were interviewed. <br><br>The Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) was a national sample survey of women and men of reproductive age designed to provide, among other things, information on fertility, family planning, child survival, and health of mothers and children. Specifically, the main objectives of the survey were to: <br>- Collect up-to-date information on fertility, infant and child mortality, and family planning <br>- Collect information on health-related matters, including breastleeding, antenatal and maternity services, vaccinations, and childhood diseases and treatment <br>- Assess the nutritional status of mothers and children <br>- Collect information on knowledge and attitudes regarding AIDS <br>- Collect information suitable for the estimation of mortality related to pregnancy and childbearing <br>- Assess the availability of health and family planning services. <br><br>MAIN FINDINGS<br><br>The findings indicate that fertility in Malawi has been declining over the last decade; at current levels a woman will give birth to an average of 6.7 children during her lifetime. Fertility in rural areas is 6.9 children per woman compared to 5.5 children in urban areas. Fertility is higher in the Central Region (7.4 children per woman) than in the Northem Region (6.7) or Southern Region (6.2). Over the last decade, the average age at which a woman first gives birth has risen slightly over the last decade from 18.3 to 18.9 years. Still, over one third of women currently under 20 years of age have either already given birlh to at least one child or are currently pregnant. <br><br>Although 58 percent of currently married women would like to have another child, only 19 percent want one within the next two years. Thirty-seven percent would prefer to walt two or more years. Nearly one quarter of married women want no more children than they already have. Thus, a majority of women (61 percent) want either to delay their next birth or end childbearing altogether. This represents the proportion of women who are potentially in need of family planning. Women reported an average ideal family size of 5.7 children (i.e., wanted fertility), one child less than the actual fertility level measured in the survey--further evidence of the need for family planning methods. <br><br>Knowledge of contraceptive methods is high among all age groups and socioeconomic strata of women and men. Most women and men also know of a source to obtain a contraceptive method, although this varies by the type of method. The contraceptive pill is the most commonly cited method known by women; men are most familiar with condoms. Despite widespread knowledge of family planning, current use of contraception remains quite low. Only 7 percent of currently married women were using a modem method and another 6 percent were using a traditional method of family planning at the time of the survey. This does, however, represent an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate (modem methods) from about 1 percent estimated from data collected in the 1984 Family Formation Survey. The modem methods most commonly used by women are the pill (2.2 percent), female sterilisation (1.7 percent), condoms (1.7 percent), and injections (1.5 percent). Men reported higher rates of contraceptive use (13 percent use of modem methods) than women. However, when comparing method-specific use rates, nearly all of the difference in use between men and women is explained by much higher condom use among men. <br><br>Early childhood mortality remains high in Malawi; the under-five mortality rate currently stands at 234 deaths per 1000 live births. The infant mortality rate was estimated at 134 per 10130 live births. This means that nearly one in seven children dies before his first birthday, and nearly one in four children does not reach his fifth birthday. The probability of child death is linked to several factors, most strikingly, low levels of maternal education and short intervals between births. Children of uneducated women are twice as likely to die in the first five years of life as children of women with a secondary education. Similarly, the probablity of under-five mortality for children with a previous birth interval of less than 2 years is two times greater than for children with a birth interval of 4 or more years. Children living in rural areas have a higher rate ofunder-fwe mortality than urban children, and children in the Central Region have higher mortality than their counterparts in the Northem and Southem Regions. Data were collected that allow estimation ofmatemalmortality. It is estimated that for every 100,000 live births, 620 women die due to causes related to pregnancy and childbearing. <br><br>The height and weight of children under five years old and their mothers were collected in the survey. The results show that nearly one half of children under age five are stunted, i.e., too short for their age; about half of these are severely stunted. By age 3, two-thirds of children are stunted. As with childhood mortality, chronic undernutrition is more common in rural areas and among children of uneducated women. <br><br>The duration of breastfeeding is relatively long in Malawi (median length, 21 months), but supplemental liquids and foods are introduced at an early age. By age 2-3 months, 76 percent of children are already receiving supplements. <br><br>Mothers were asked to report on recent episodes of illness among their young children. The results indicate that children age 6-23 months are the most vulnerable to fever, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhea. Over half of the children in this age group were reported to have had a fever, about 40 percent had a bout with diarrhea, and 20 percent had symptoms indicating ARI in the two-week period before the survey. Less than half of recently sick children had been taken to a health facility for treatment. Sixty-three percent of children with diarrhea were given rehydration therapy, using either prepackaged rehydration salts or a home-based preparation. However, one quarter of children with diarrhea received less fluid than normal during the illness, and for 17 percent of children still being breastfed, breastfeeding of the sick child was reduced. <br><br>Use of basic, preventive maternal and child health services is generally high. For 90 percent of recent births, mothers had received antenatal care from a trained medical person, most commonly a nurse or trained midwife. For 86 percent of births, mothers had received at least one dose of tetanus toxoid during pregnancy. Over half of recent births were delivered in a health facility. <br><br>Child vaccination coverage is high; 82 percent of children age 12-23 months had received the full complement of recommended vaccines, 67 percent by exact age 12 months. BCG coverage and first dose coverage for DPT and polio vaccine were 97 percent. However, 9 percent of children age 12-23 months who received the first doses of DPT and polio vaccine failed to eventually receive the recommended third doses. <br><br>Information was collected on knowledge and attitudes regarding AIDS. General knowledge of AIDS is nearly universal in Malawi; 98 percent of men and 95 percent of women said they had heard of AIDS. Further, the vast majority of men and women know that the disease is transmitted through sexual intercourse. Men tended to know more different ways of disease transmission than women, and were more likely to mention condom use as a means to prevent spread of AIDS. Women, especially those living in rural areas, are more likely to hold misconceptions about modes of disease transmission. Thirty percent of rural women believe that AIDS can not be prevented.",0048952,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Malawi - Demographic and Health Survey 2000,"The 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) is a nationally represen­tative sample survey covering 14,213 house­holds, 13,220 women age 15-49, and 3,092 men age 15-54. The 2000 MDHS is similar, but much expanded in size and scope, to the 1992 MDHS. The survey was designed to provide information on fertility trends, family planning knowledge and use, early childhood mortality, various indicators of maternal and child health and nutrition, HIV/AIDS, adult and maternal mortality, and malaria control programme indicators. Unlike earlier surveys in Malawi, the 2000 MDHS sample was sufficiently large to allow for estimates of certain indicators to be produced for 11 districts in addition to esti­mates for national, regional, and urban-rural domains. Twenty-two mobile survey teams, trained and supervised by the National Statisti­cal Office, conducted the survey from July to November 2000. <br><br>The principal aim of the 2000 MDHS project is to provide up-to-date information on fertility and childhood mortality levels, nuptiality, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, use of maternal and child health services, and knowledge and behaviours related to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.  It was designed as a follow-on to the 1992 MDHS survey, a national-level survey of similar scope.  The 2000 MDHS survey also strived to collect data that would be comparable to those collected under the international Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), sponsored by UNICEF.  <br><br>In broad terms, the 2000 MDHS survey aimed to : <br>- Assess trends in Malawi's demographic indicators-principally, fertility and mortality <br>- Assist in the evaluation of Malawi's health, population, and nutrition programmes <br>- Advance survey methodology in Malawi and contribute to national and international databases. In more specific terms, the 2000 MDHS survey was designed to provide data on the family planning and fertility behaviour of the Malawian population and to thereby enable policymakers to evaluate and enhance family planning initiatives in the country. <br>- Measure changes in fertility and contraceptive prevalence and at the same time, study the factors that affect these changes, such as marriage patterns, desire for children, availability of contraception, breastfeeding habits, and important social and economic factors. <br>- Examine basic indicators of maternal and child health and welfare in Malawi, including nutritional status, use of antenatal and maternity services, treatment of recent episodes of childhood illness, and use of immunisation services.  A particular emphasis was placed on the area of malaria programmes, including prevention activities and treatment of episodes of fever. <br>- Describe levels and patterns of knowledge and behaviour related to the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. <br>- Measure the level of adult and maternal mortality at the national level. <br>- Assess the status of women in the country. <br><br>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS<br><br>- FERTILITY Fertility Decline. The 2000 MDHS data indicate that there has been a modest decline in fertility since the 1992 MDHS. Large Fertility Differentials. Fertility levels remain high in Malawi, especially in rural parts of the country. The total fertility rate among rural women is 6.7 births per woman compared with 4.5 births in urban areas. Childbearing at Young Ages. One-third of adolescent females (age 15-19) have either already had a child or are currently pregnant. <br><br>- FAMILY PLANNING Increasing Use of Contraception. A principle cause of the fertility decline in Malawi is the steady increase in contraceptive use over the last decade. <br>Changing Method Mix. Currently, the most widely used methods among married women are injectable contraceptives (16 per­cent), female sterilisation (5 percent), and the pill (3 percent). Source of Family Planning Methods. The survey results show that government-run facilities remain the major source for contra­ceptives in Malawi-providing family planning methods to 68 percent of the current users. <br><br>- CHILD HEALTH AND SURVIVAL Progress in Reducing Early Childhood Mortality. The 2000 MDHS data indicate that mortality of children under age 5 has declined since the early 1990s. <br>Childhood Vaccination Coverage Declines. The 2000 MDHS results show that 70 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated. <br>Improved Breastfeeding Practices. The 2000 MDHS results show that exclusive breast-feeding of children under 4 months of age has increased to 63 percent from only 3 percent in the 1992 MDHS. Nutritional Status of Children. The results show no appreciable change in the nutritional status of children in Malawi since 1992; still, nearly half (49 percent) of the children under age five are chronically mal­nourished or stunted in their growth. <br><br>- MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAMME INDICATORS Bednets. The use of insecticide-treated bednets (mosquito nets) is a primary health intervention proven to reduce malaria transmission. <br>Treatment of Fever in Children Under Age Five. The survey found that 42 percent of children under age five had a fever in the two weeks preceding the survey. <br><br>- WOMEN'S HEALTH Maternal Health Care. The survey findings indicate that use of antenatal services remains high in Malawi. Constraints to Use of Health Services. Women in the 2000 MDHS were asked whether certain circumstances constrain their access to and use of health services for themselves. <br>Rising Maternal Mortality. The survey collected data allowing measurement of maternal mortality. For the period 1994-2000, the maternal mortality ratio was estimated at 1,120 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. This represents a rise from 620 maternal deaths per 100,000 estimated from the 1992 MDHS for the period 1986-1992. <br><br>- HIV/AIDS Impact of the Epidemic on Adult Mortality. All-cause mortality has risen by 76 percent among men and 74 percent among women age 15-49 during the 1990s. The age patterns of the increase are consistent with causes related to HIV/AIDS. <br>Improved Knowledge of AIDS Preven­tion Methods. The 2000 MDHS results indi­cate that practical AIDS prevention knowledge has improved since the 1996 MKAPH survey. <br>Condom Use. One of the main objectives of the National AIDS Control Programme is to encourage consistent and correct use of con­doms, especially in high-risk sexual encounters. The <br>HIV-testing Experience. The 2000 MDHS data show that 9 percent of women and 15 percent of men have been tested for HIV. However, more than 70 percent of both men and women, while not yet tested, said that they would like to be tested.",0048948,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Malawi - Second Integrated Household Survey 2004-2005,"The principal focus of the survey is an issue of interest to us all . the welfare level of Malawian individuals and households. The survey data will be used in analyses to determine what proportion of Malawians are unable to meet their basic needs to enjoy an adequate standard of living and are living in poverty. These studies will also consider what accounts for some households being able to attain and sustain such a standard of living and what might be done to assist those households and individuals now living in poverty to escape poverty. The information collected in the IHS also will be used in a range of other studies, including examining employment, health, nutritional status, agriculture, as well as better understanding how households respond to changes in the macroeconomic environment. As you will learn, the data collected using the IHS is particularly rich because it integrates such a wide range of aspects of household and individual characteristics.",0048946,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Malawi - Demographic and Health Survey 2004,"The 2004 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 11,698 women age 15­49 and 3,261 men age 15-54. The main purpose of the 2004 MDHS is to provide policymakers and programme managers with detailed information on fertility, family planning, childhood and adult mortality, maternal and child health, as well as knowledge of and attitudes related to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The 2004 MDHS is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Malawi as a followup of the 1992 and 2000 MDHS surveys, and the 1996 Malawi Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices in Health Survey. New features of the 2004 MDHS include the collection of information on use of mosquito nets, domestic violence, anaemia testing of women and children under 5, and HIV testing of adults. <br><br>The 2004 MDHS survey was implemented by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The Ministry of Health and Population, the National AIDS Commission (NAC), the National Economic Council, and the Ministry of Gender contributed to the development of the questionnaires for the survey. Most of the funds for the local costs of the survey were provided by multiple donors through the NAC. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided additional funds for the technical assistance through ORC Macro. The Department for International Development (DfID) of the British Government, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) also provided funds for the survey. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention provided technical assistance in HIV testing. <br><br>The survey used a two-stage sample based on the 1998 Census of Population and Housing and was designed to produce estimates for key indicators for ten large districts in addition to estimates for national, regional, and urban-rural domains. Fieldwork for the 2004 MDHS was carried out by 22 mobile interviewing teams. Data collection commenced on 4 October 2004 and was completed on 31 January 2005. <br><br>The principal aim of the 2004 MDHS project was to provide up-to-date information on fertility and childhood mortality levels, nuptiality, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, use of maternal and child health services, and knowledge and behaviours related to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. It was designed as a follow-on to the 2000 MDHS survey, a national-level survey of similar scope. The 2004 MDHS survey, unlike the 2000 MDHS, collected blood samples which were later tested for HIV in order to estimate HIV prevalence in Malawi. <br><br>In broad terms, the 2004 MDHS survey aimed to: <br>- Assess trends in Malawi's demographic indicators, principally fertility and mortality <br>- Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of Malawi's health, population, and nutrition programmes <br>- Advance survey methodology in Malawi and contribute to national and international databases <br>- Provide national-level estimates of HIV prevalence for women age 15-49 and men age 15-54. <br><br>In more specific terms, the 2004 MDHS survey was designed to:  <br>- Provide data on the family planning and fertility behaviour of the Malawian population and thereby enable policymakers to evaluate and enhance family planning initiatives in the country <br>- Measure changes in fertility and contraceptive prevalence and analyse the factors that affect these changes, such as marriage patterns, desire for children, availability of contraception, breastfeeding habits, and important social and economic factors <br>- Examine basic indicators of maternal and child health and welfare in Malawi, including nutritional status, use of antenatal and maternity services, treatment of recent episodes of childhood illness, and use of immunisation services. Particular emphasis was placed on malaria programmes, including malaria prevention activities and treatment of episodes of fever. <br>- Provide levels and patterns of knowledge and behaviour related to the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections <br>- Provide national estimates of HIV prevalence <br>- Measure the level of infant and adult mortality including maternal mortality at the national level <br>- Assess the status of women in the country. <br><br>MAIN FINDINGS<br><br>Fertility - Fertility Levels and Trends. While there has been a significant decline in fertility in the past two decades from 7.6 children in the early 1980s to 6.0 children per woman in the early 2000s, compared with selected countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, such as Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya, and Uganda, the total fertility rate (TFR) in Malawi is high, lower only than Uganda (6.9). <br><br>Family planning - Knowledge of Contraception. Know­ledge of family planning is nearly universal, with 97 percent of women age 15-49 and 97 percent of men age 15-54 knowing at least one modern method of family planning. The most widely known modern methods of contraception among all women are injectables (93 percent), the pill and male condom (90 percent each), and female sterilisation (83 percent). <br><br>Maternal health - Antenatal Care. There has been little change in the coverage of antenatal care (ANC) from a medical professional since 2000 (93 percent in 2004 compared with 91 percent in 2000). Most women receive ANC from a nurse or a midwife (82 percent), although 10 percent go to a doctor or a clinical officer. A small proportion (2 percent) receives ANC from a traditional birth attendant, and 5 percent do not receive any ANC. Only 8 percent of women initiated ANC before the fourth month of pregnancy, a marginal increase from 7 percent in the 2000 MDHS. <br><br>Adult and Maternal Mortality. Com­parison of data from the 2000 and 2004 MDHS surveys indicates that mortality for both women and men has remained at the same levels since 1997 (11-12 deaths per 1,000). <br><br>Child health - Childhood Mortality. Data from the 2004 MDHS show that for the 2000-2004 period, the infant mortality rate is 76 per 1,000 live births, child mortality is 62 per 1,000, and the under-five mortality rate is 133 per 1,000 live births.<br><br>Nutrition - Breastfeeding Practices. Breastfeeding is nearly universal in Malawi. Ninety-eight percent of children are breastfed for some period of time. The median duration of breastfeeding in Malawi in 2004 is 23.2 months, one month shorter than in 2000. <br><br>HIV/AIDS - Awareness of AIDS. Knowledge of AIDS among women and men in Malawi is almost universal. This is true across age group, urban-rural residence, marital status, wealth index, and education. Nearly half of women and six in ten men can identify the two most common misconceptions about the transmission of HIV-HIV can be transmitted by mosquito bites, and HIV can be transmitted by supernatural means-and know that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus.",0048944,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Malawi - Technology Adoption and Risk Initiative Household Baseline Survey 2006,"Malawi Technology Adoption and Risk Initiative (MTARI) household baseline survey is a part of a larger impact evaluation study, being conducted by the World Bank and the University of Michigan researchers. The randomized field experiment was designed to examine whether provision of insurance against a major source of production risk induces farmers to take out loans to adopt a new crop technology. The study sample was composed of roughly 800 maize and groundnut farmers. Randomly selected half of the farmers in the sample were offered a credit to purchase high-yielding hybrid maize and groundnut seeds for planting in the November 2006 crop season. The other half of farmers were offered a similar credit package, but were also required to purchase (at actuarially fair rates) a weather insurance policy that partially or fully forgave the loan in the event of poor rainfall. In Malawi, the dominant source of production risk is the level of rainfall. <br><br>The household baseline survey was administered to all farmers in the sample in September and October 2006. The survey covered income, education, assets, income-generating activities (including detailed information on crop production and crop choice), measures of risk aversion, and knowledge about financial products such as credit and insurance.",0048942,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Malawi - Facilitating Savings for Agriculture: Field Experimental Evidence from Malawi 2009-2010,"The survey data accompanies the paper, ""Facilitating Savings for Agriculture: Field Experimental Evidence from Malawi,”. The investigators implemented a randomized intervention among Malawian farmers aimed at facilitating formal savings for agricultural inputs. Treated farmers were offered the opportunity to have their cash crop harvest proceeds deposited directly into new bank accounts in their own names, while farmers in the control group were paid harvest proceeds in cash (the status quo). The treatment led to higher savings in the months immediately prior to the next agricultural planting season, and raised agricultural input usage in that season. They also find positive treatment effects on subsequent crop sale proceeds and household expenditures. Because the treatment effect on savings was only a small fraction of the treatment effect on the value of agricultural inputs, mechanisms other than alleviation of savings constraints per se are needed to explain the treatment’s impact on input utilization. Authors discuss other possible mechanisms through which treatment effects may have operated.<br><br>Data used in this paper come from two surveys as well as from administrative records of  Bank of Malawi (OBM).",0048935,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Malawi - Protecting Early Childhood Development in Malawi Impact Evaluation Survey 2011-2012,"The Government of Malawi recognizes that investment in early childhood development (ECD) is a cost-effective strategy to meet its development objectives in areas of health, nutrition, education, and social protection. In Malawi, ECD is delivered through an extensive network of community initiated and owned centers for the most vulnerable children under the age of six, known as Community-based Childcare Centers (CCBCs). The recent global food, fuel, and financial crises hit Malawi hard. Constrained government budgets and activities for ECD have jeopardized the service delivery of the existing ECD centers which cover about a third of all 3-6 year old children. From 2010 to 2012, the Protecting Early Childhood Development Project (PECD) aimed to mitigate the negative effects of the recent global crises on young children and to start building foundations against future crises.

Madagascar - Enquête Nationale Démographique et Sanitaire 1992,"L'ENDS est une enquête par sondage, réalisée au niveau national, dont l'objectif est de fournir des informations détaillées sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la mortalité des enfants et la santé de la mère et de l'enfant. Au cours de sa réalisation, de mai à novembre 1992, 5944 ménages et 6260 femmes en âge de procréer (15-49 ans) ont été enquêtés avec succès. <br><br>L'ENDS répond à l'aspiration du programme de la Politique Nationale de Population peur le développement économique, social et sanitaire du pays. L'objectif de l'ENDS est de: <br>- Recueillir les données au niveau national permettant de calculer les taux de fécondité et de mortalité infantile et juvénile. <br>- Analyser les facteurs associés aux niveaux et tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité infantile et juvénile. Les indicateurs obtenus aideront les planificateurs et autres responsables à élaborer des plans et une stratégie de développement économique et social. <br>- Evaluer les niveaux de connaissance et d'utilisation des moyens contraceptifs et estimer la pratique potentielle future, ainsi que les attitudes vis-å-vis de la planification familiale. <br>- Evaluer la santé de la mère et de l'enfant : couverture vaccinale, prévalence et traitement de la fièvre, des maladies respiratoires et de la diarrhée, soins prénatals et assistance à l'accouchement, allaitement et état nutritionnel des enfants. <br>- Recueillir des données sur les services sanitaires ainsi que leur prestation. <br>- Contribuer au développement des capacités et ressources nécessaires à la réalisation périodique d'enquêtes démographiques et de santé. Par la suite faisant partie d'un vaste programme international, les données seront insérées dans une base de données utilisable par les organismes et les chercheurs qui s'intéressent aux problèmes de population et de santé dans le monde entier. <br><br>RESULTATS<br><br>Les résultats de l'ENDS montrent, qu'au niveau national, la fécondité est forte : à la fin de sa vie féconde, une femme malgache aura en moyenne 6,1 enfants. Les femmes les plus fécondes résident dans les zones rurales ou sont sans instruction. Les femmes de la capitale (3,2 enfants par femme) ont près de deux fois moins d'enfants que celles du milieu rural (6,7 enfants), il en est de même pour les femmes de niveau d'instruction secondaire II ou plus (3,2 enfants) en comparaison des femmes sans niveau d'instruction (6,5 enfants). L'une des principales caractéristiques de cette fécondité élevée est sa précocité. Plus d'une femme sur six a son premier enfant avant l'âge de 19 ans. <br><br>Le mariage est quasi universel et l'entrée en union est très précoce : l'âge médian à la première union est estimé à 18,3 ans. Les générations les plus récentes semblent, toutefois, entrer en union moins précocement que les plus anciennes : l'âge médian à la première union est de 19,5 ans pour les femmes de 20-24 ans contre 17, I pour celles de 45-49 ans. Malgré ce recul de 1'âge d'entrée en première union, l'activité sexuelle débute toujours très t6t : plus d'une femme sur deux a eu ses premiers rapports sexuels avant l'âge de 17 ans, <br><br>Presque les deux tiers des femmes connaissent des méthodes contraceptives (62 pour cent) et, en particulier des méthodes modernes (57 pour cent). Mais le nombre d'utilisatrices est encore faible dans le pays; si 24 pour cent des enquêtées ont déclaré avoir déjà utilisé une méthode de contraception, seulement 13 pour cent en utilisaient au moment de l'enquête, dont 4 pour cent une méthode moderne. Il faut toutefois souligner qu'à Madagascar, peu d'informations sont diffusées sur la planification familiale : en effet, 93 pour cent des femmes ont déclaré n'avoir rien entendu à la radio ou à la télévision, ni rien lu dans des journaux ou affiches å propos de la planification familiale, durant le mois qui a précédé l'enquête. <br><br>La prévalence contraceptive est plus élevée chez les femmes résidant en milieu urbain ou ayant un niveau d'instruction : 51 pour cent des femmes en union résidant dans la capitale et 57 pour cent de celles ayant un niveau d'instruction secondaire 1I ou plus utilisaient des méthodes modernes de contraception au moment de l'enquête, contre 12 pour cent en milieu rural et 3 pour cent seulement parmi les femmes sans niveau d'instruction. <br><br>Toutefois, les besoins non satisfaits en matière de planification familiale sont relativement importants. En effet 35 pour cent des femmes en union non-utilisatrices de la contraception, désirent espacer ou limiter les naissances (respectivement 16 pour cent et 19 pour cent). La demande potentielle est, enfin, estimée à 51 pour cent (22 pour cent pour l'espacement des naissances et 29 pour cent pour la limitation des naissances). <br><br>Parmi les femmes non-utilisatrices de la contraception au moment de l'enquête, 42 pour cent ont l'intention de l'utiliser dans le futur, dont 36 pour cent dans un avenir très proche (dans les 12 mois suivant l'interview). La majorité de ces femmes utiliseraient les méthodes modernes de contraception (59 pour cent), notamment les injections (26 pour cent) et la pilule (21 pour cent). En fait 40 pour cent des femmes malgaches ne désirent plus avoir d'enfants. Si les femmes malgaches avaient le nombre d'enfants qu'elles désirent, elles auraient, en moyenne, 5,2 enfants à la fin de leur vie féconde, au lieu de 6,1 enfants comme cela a été estimé au moment de l'enquête. <br><br>La mortalité des enfants demeure toujours élevée : sur 1000 naissances, 93 décèdent avant d'atteindre l'Age d'un an, et sur 1000 atteignant leur premier anniversaire, 77 décèdent avant l'âge de cinq ans. La mortalité infantile est plus faible en milieu urbain qu'en milieu rural (75 pour mille contre 107 pour mille). Mais, après le premier anniversaire, les différences de mortalité sont considérablement réduites (73 pour mille contre 86 pour mille). L'amélioration des conditions sanitaires et l'accessibilité aux services de santé dans les milieux urbains expliqueraient ces différences de mortalité. <br><br>Pour plus de la majorité des naissances (56 pour cent), la mère a effectue la première visite prénatale avant le sixième mois de grossesse, et pour plus de 30 pour cent, après le sixième mois. Moins de 43 pour cent des femmes suivent les recommandations de l'OMS qui considèrent qu'une femme devrait effectuer au moins quatre visites prénatales, espacées régulièrement tout au long de sa grossesse. Pour 41 pour cent des naissances, la mère n'a reçu aucune injection antitétanique. <br><br>En milieu urbain, pour pratiquement les trois quarts des naissances, les mères ont été vaccinées contre le tétanos (70 pour cent) alors qu'en milieu rural, cette proportion n'atteint que 57 pour cent. Selon le niveau d'instruction de la mère, les différences observées sont encore plus importantes : 75 pour cent des mères ayant au moins un niveau d'instruction secondaire ont reçu au moins une dose de vaccin antitétanique contre 46 pour cent des mères sans instruction. <br><br>La majorité des accouchements (54 pour cent) ont eu lieu à la maison contre seulement 45 pour cent dans des établissements sanitaires. L'assistance médicale lors de l'accouchement n'est assurée par les infirmières et sages-femmes que pour 49 pour cent des naissances. L'utilisation des services de santé pour les accouchements n'est pas uniforme dans le pays : dans la capitale, pour 59 pour cent des naissances, l'accouchement a eu lieu dans une formation sanitaire, contre 44 pour cent en milieu rural. <br><br>Les trois quarts des enfants ont reçu une injection de BCG et la moitié des enfants (54 pour cent) sont complètement vaccinés contre la polio. La vaccination contre la rougeole est moins fréquente que celle contre le BCG : elle ne concerne que 54 pour cent des enfants. Globalement, moins d'un tiers des enfants (32 pour cent) ont reçu tous les vaccins avant le premier anniversaire et près d'un enfant sur quatre n'en a reçu aucun avant cet âge. La couverture vaccinale demeure plus importante en milieu urbain (58 pour cent des enfants ont reçu toutes les vaccinations) qu'en milieu rural (41 pour cent). Les différences sont encore plus prononcées selon le niveau d'instruction de la mère : 69 pour cent des enfants dont la mère a au moins un niveau d'instruction secondaire II ont reçu tous les vaccins contre seulement 29 pour cent de ceux dont la mère n'a aucun niveau d'instruction. <br><br>Dans l'ensemble, 16 pour cent des enfants auraient souffert simultanément de toux et de problèmes respiratoires durant les deux dernières semaines ayant précédé l'interview. Ces symptômes sont particulièrement fréquents chez les enfants de moins d'un an, en particulier chez les 6-11 mois (24 pour cent). La fièvre a touché 27 pour cent des enfants de moins de 5 ans et plus fréquemment les 6-23 mois (34 pour cent). Plus d'un enfant sur I0 de moins de 5 ans (12 pour cent) avait eu, au moins, un épisode diarrhéique au cours des deux dernières semaines. Durant les Episodes diarrh6iques, seulement 55 pour cent des enfants ont reçu un supplément liquide, 15 pour cent une solution d'eau, de sel et de sucre préparée à la maison, et 14 pour cent ont eu un sachet SRO. <br><br>D'une manière générale, les résultats de l'enquête, les enfants dont la mère est sans instruction et/ou réside en milieu rural sont plus fréquemment atteints de maladies infantiles et bénéficient le moins de soins médicaux. <br><br>La presque totalité des enfants malgaches (97 pour cent) ont été allaités. Malgré cette pratique quasi- universelle de l'allaitement, dans leur majorité, les mères ne dorment pas le sein le premier jour. Concernant les seuls enfants derniers-nés, seulement 45 pour cent ont été mis au sein pour la première fois durant leur premier jour d'existence, dont 6 pour cent durant la première heure suivant la naissance. <br><br>La majorité des enfants (51 pour cent) souffrent d'un retard de croissance, dont presque la moitié (24 pour cent) sous une forme sévère. Ces niveaux sont respectivement 22 et 24 fois plus élevés que ceux que l'on s'attend à trouver dans une population où les enfants sont en bonne santé. Dans l'ensemble 5 pour cent des enfants sont émaciés, dont 0,3 pour cent sous une forme sévère : ces proportions sont respectivement 2 fois et 3 fois plus élevées que celles attendues dans une population en bonne santé et bien nourrie. Il apparait ici que 39 pour cent des enfants malgaches de moins de cinq ans souffrent d'insuffisance pondérale, dont 9 pour cent sous une forme sévère.",0048900,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Madagascar - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1997,"L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé à Madagascar (EDS 1997) est une enquête nationale par sondage. Elle a été exécutée par la Direction de la Démographie et des Statistiques Sociales de l'Institut National de la Statistique. Au cours de l'enquête, réalisée de septembre à décembre 1997, 7 060 femmes âgées de 15-49 ans ont été interviewées avec succès. <br><br>L'objectif de l'EDS est de recueillir des données au niveau national permettant de : <br>- connaître les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité infantile et juvénile ainsi que les facteurs déterminant leur évolution. Les indicateurs obtenus aideront les planificateurs et autres responsables à élaborer des plans et une stratégie de développement économique et social; <br>- déterminer les niveaux de connaissance et d'utilisation des moyens contraceptifs et estimer la pratique potentielle future. Obtenir des informations sur le nombre idéal d'enfants et sur l'attitude vis-à-vis de la planification familiale; <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant : soins prénatals et assistance à l'accouchement, allaitement, supplémentation en vitamine A, couverture vaccinale, prévalence de l'anémie, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies chez les moins de 3 ans; <br>- déterminer l'état nutritionnel des mères et des enfants de moins de 3 ans au moyen de mesures anthropométriques (poids et taille); <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur la connaissance, les opinions et attitudes des femmes vis-à-vis des Maladies Sexuellement Transmissibles (MST) et du sida; <br>- mesurer le niveau de mortalité maternelle au niveau national; <br>- contribuer au développement des capacités et ressources nécessaires à la réalisation périodique d'enquêtes démographiques et de santé. En outre, faisant partie d'un vaste programme international, les données seront insérées dans une base de données utilisables par les organismes et les chercheurs qui s'intéressent aux problèmes de population et de santé dans le monde entier. <br><br>RESULTATS<br><br>Près de la moitié de la population (46 %) est composée de jeunes de moins de 15 ans, alors que les moins de 5 ans en représentent 18 %. <br><br>Une femme de 15-49 ans sur cinq (21 %) et un homme de 15-59 ans sur cinq (19 %) sont sans instruction. Quel que soit le sexe, plus de la moitié des jeunes de 6-15 ans ont fréquenté l'école, et le taux de fréquentation est plus élevé en milieu urbain (74 %) qu'en milieu rural (50 %). <br><br>La fécondité reste très élevée à Madagascar. Avec les niveaux actuels de fécondité, les femmes malgaches donneront naissance, en moyenne, à 6,0 enfants durant leur vie féconde. Cette fécondité a peu changé ces dernières années et se caractérise par une forte précocité. <br><br>Presque deux tiers des femmes de 15-49 ans (63 %) sont en union, soit mariées, soit vivant en union consensuelle, alors que près du quart des femmes de 15-49 ans (23 %) sont encore célibataires. La proportion des célibataires diminue très rapidement avec l'âge, passant de 66 % chez les femmes de 15-19 ans à 6 % chez celles de 35-39 ans et à 1 % chez celles de 45-49 ans. <br><br>L'activité sexuelle débute relativement tôt: à 15 ans, une femme sur cinq (20 %) a déjà eu un premier rapport sexuel. À l'âge de 18 ans, la proportion passe à 63 %. À 25 ans, c'est la quasi-totalité des femmes (92 %) qui ont eu leurs premiers rapports sexuels. <br><br>Parmi les femmes actuellement en union, 37 % ont déclaré ne plus vouloir d'enfant et 32 % désirent espacer leurs naissances, c'est-à-dire veulent attendre au moins deux ans avant d'avoir un autre enfant. Si 84 % des femmes sans enfant manifestent le désir de donner naissance à un enfant, cette proportion passe à 33 % chez celles qui ont déjà un enfant et à 6 % chez celles qui ont déjà six enfants ou plus. <br><br>Le nombre idéal d'enfants pour l'ensemble des femmes est de 5,3, et celui déclaré par les femmes en union est de 5,7 enfants. Si toutes les naissances non désirées étaient évitées, la fécondité totale des femmes (5,2 enfants) serait inférieure de près d'un enfant à la fécondité réelle (6,0 enfants). <br><br>Parmi l'ensemble des femmes interrogées, près de sept sur dix ont déclaré connaître au moins une méthode moderne de contraception. Les méthodes les plus connues sont l'injection (57 %), la pilule (53 %) et le condom (50 %). Une amélioration du niveau de connaissance de la contraception moderne est observée entre 1992 et 1997, passant de 57 % à 68 %. <br><br>Chez les femmes en union, 31 % ont déjà utilisé, au moins, une méthode contraceptive à un moment quelconque de leur vie, dont 17 % une méthode moderne. Au moment de l'enquête, 19 % des femmes en union utilisaient une méthode, dont 10 % une méthode moderne. <br><br>Les deux tiers des femmes sont favorables à l'utilisation des média pour la diffusion d'informations sur la contraception. Cependant, plus des trois quarts des femmes ont déclaré n'avoir entendu, ni à la radio, ni à la télévision, aucun message relatif à la planification familiale durant le mois précédant l'enquête. Parmi les femmes en union et non-utilisatrices de la contraception au moment de l'enquête, 45 % ont manifesté leur intention d'utiliser une méthode dans l'avenir. <br><br>Plus du quart des femmes en union (26 %) ont des besoins non satisfaits en matière de planification familiale, soit pour la limitation (12 %), soit pour l'espacement des naissances (14 %). Si les femmes en union arrivaient à satisfaire leurs besoins en matière de contraception, la prévalence contraceptive pourrait atteindre 45 %. <br><br>Pour plus des trois quarts des naissances survenues au cours des trois années ayant précédé l'enquête, les mères se sont rendues en consultation prénatale auprès d'un professionnel de la santé. En outre, dans un cas sur deux, les mères ont reçu, au moins, une injection antitétanique pendant la grossesse. <br><br>Les accouchements à domicile (65 %) sont à peu près deux fois plus fréquents que les accouchements dans des établissements sanitaires (34 %). Moins de la moitié des naissances (47 %) ont été assistées par du personnel qualifié-soit un médecin, soit une infirmière, soit une sage-femme-lors de l'accouchement. Le reste des naissances ont été assistées par des personnes non qualifiées, principalement des accoucheuses traditionnelles (39 %) et des parents ou amis (12 %). <br><br>Selon les carnets de vaccination et les déclarations des mères, seulement 36 % des enfants ont reçu tous les vaccins recommandés par le Programme Élargi de Vaccination (PEV) : BCG, trois doses de polio et de DTCoq, et rougeole. À l'inverse, un enfant sur cinq (20 %) n'a reçu aucune de ces vaccinations. Un peu moins de la moitié des enfants de 12-23 mois ont reçu les trois doses réglementaires du vaccin antipoliomyélitique oral (VPO), du vaccin DTCoq et du vaccin contre la rougeole. De plus, 66 % des enfants ont reçu le BCG. <br><br>Seulement 31 % des enfants de 12 à 35 mois ont reçu tous les vaccins avant l'âge d'un an. Quarante cinq pour cent des enfants ont reçu la troisième dose de DTCoq et du vaccin antipoliomyélitique, 40 % ont reçu le vaccin contre la rougeole et 65 % ont reçu le BCG avant l'âge d'un an. <br><br>Plus du quart des enfants de moins de trois ans (27 %) ont eu, au moins, un épisode diarrhéique au cours des deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête et, dans 4 % des cas, la diarrhée était accompagnée de sang. Parmi les enfants ayant eu la diarrhée, 40 % ont été menés dans un établissement de santé, 23 % ont reçu des sachets de SRO et 1 % ont reçu une solution d'eau, de sel et de sucre préparée à la maison. Alors que, dans l'ensemble, 63 % des enfants ont reçu davantage de liquides au cours des épisodes diarrhéiques, plus du tiers (34 %) n'ont bénéficié d'aucune thérapie de réhydratation. <br><br>La quasi-totalité des enfants malgaches nés dans les trois années ayant précédé l'enquête ont été allaités (97 %). Un tiers des enfants sont mis au sein dès la première heure et plus des trois quarts dans les 24 heures après la naissance. La durée médiane de l'allaitement est de 20,7 mois. <br><br>Presque la moitié des enfants de moins de 3 ans (48 %) souffrent d'un retard de croissance, c'est-à­dire qu'ils ont une taille trop petite par rapport à leur âge. Près d'un enfant sur cinq présente un retard de croissance de forme sévère. Le retard de croissance approche les deux tiers chez les enfants âgés de 12 à 23 mois. <br><br>Sept pour cent des enfants de moins de trois ans sont émaciés, c'est-à-dire qu'ils sont trop maigres par rapport à leur taille. Le groupe d'âges le plus touché est celui des 12-23 mois (12 %). La proportion d'enfants émaciés est plus faible en ville (5 %) qu'en milieu rural (8 %). <br><br>La taille moyenne des femmes malgaches est de 153,0 centimètres et se situe au-dessus du seuil critique (entre 140 et 150 centimètres selon les populations) en-deça duquel une femme peut être considérée à risque. En moyenne, les femmes malgaches ont un Indice de Masse Corporelle de 20,4. Une femme sur cinq a un IMC inférieur à 18,5 et peut donc être considérée comme atteinte de malnutrition aiguë. <br><br>Quarante deux pour cent des mères sont atteintes d'anémie : 30 % sous forme légère, 11 % sous forme modérée et 1 % sous forme sévère. Le risque d'anémie est beaucoup plus important chez les femmes enceintes-22 % d'entre elles sont atteintes d'anémie modérée ou sévère-que chez les femmes qui ne le sont pas (10 %). Les deux tiers des enfants de moins de trois ans sont atteints d'anémie : 18 % d'anémie légère, 42 % d'anémie modérée et 7 % d'anémie sévère. <br><br>La mortalité des enfants reste toujours très élevée à Madagascar. Cependant, elle a connuune baisse, bien que très modeste, au cours des quinze dernières années. Durant la période la plus récente (0-4 ans avant l'enquête), sur 1000 enfants nés vivants, 96 sont décédés avant l'âge d'un an ; sur 1 000 enfants survivants au premier anniversaire, 70 sont décédés avant d'atteindre l'âge de cinq ans. Globalement, sur 1000 enfants vivants à la naissance, 159, ou un enfant sur six, décèdent avant leur cinquième anniversaire. <br><br>La mortalité maternelle est également élevée à Madagascar. Pour la période 1990-1997, parmi les décès de femmes âgées de 15-49 ans, près d'un sur quatre était associé à la grossesse, à l'accouchement ou à ses suites. Pour la même période, le taux de mortalité maternelle est estimé à 488 décès pour 100000 naissances vivantes. Avec ce niveau de mortalité, une femme sur 33 court le risque de décéder pour cause maternelle pendant les âges de procréation. <br><br>Dans l'ensemble, 54 % des femmes interrogées ont déjà entendu parler d'au moins une maladie sexuellement transmissible (MST).

Lebanon - Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees - 2018,"The Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR-2018) was conducted jointly by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP, dataviz.vam.wfp.org). Now in its sixth year, the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) assesses a representative sample of Syrian refugee families to identify changes and trends in their situation. The Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees who have fled their country’s conflict since 2011 (including nearly one million registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2018).  The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains the largest concentration of refugees per capita and the fourth largest refugee population in the world. VASyR includes a sample of 4,446 Syrian refugee households from 26 districts across Lebanon. The assessment demonstrates that despite the large scale assistance and the efforts of Lebanon and its partners that have resulted in improvements in economic vulnerability and stabilization in education, food security and some improvements in the situation for women, girls and female-headed households, Syrian refugees still remain very vulnerable.

Lebanon - Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance: Impact Evaluation on the Well-Being of Syrian Refugees 2020,"Since the onset of the Syrian crisis, the humanitarian community has increasingly relied on cash-based assistance provided from donor contributions and implemented by aid partners under the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan to support the affected population. In November 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in the delivery of multi-purpose cash (MPC) to assist the most economically vulnerable Syrian refugee households to meet their basic needs. <br><br>This study aims to measure the short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) causal impact of the $173.50 and $175 MPC assistance provided by WFP and UNHCR respectively, over and above the $27 per person per month assistance, as well as the impact of discontinuation from MPC on the well-being of Syrian refugees. This report presents the causal impact on multiple dimensions of well-being, namely household expenditures, food security, housing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, employment, health and decision-making. <br><br>The key take-away messages from the study are: <br>1. The impact of MPC materialised across most dimensions of well-being in the long-term, indicating the importance of households' access to a longer duration of MPC.<br>2. The benefits of MPC fade for many indicators within 4 to 10 months after discontinuation, and households' well-being returned to pre-assistance levels for most indicators and dropped slightly below the pre-assistance baseline for others. <br>3. The findings would suggest that there are benefits to instituting longer cash cycles and/or linking MPC to other services through a cash plus approach to expand and extend the positive impact of cash on beneficiary households and ensure sustainable impact. <br><br>A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date.",0048784,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Kyrgyz Republic - Demographic and Health Survey 1997,"The 1997 the Kyrgyz Republic Demographic and Health Survey (KRDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 3,848 women age 15-49.  Fieldwork was conducted from August to November 1997. The KRDHS was sponsored by the Ministry of Health (MOH), and was funded by the United States Agency for International Development.  The Research Institute of Obstetrics and Pediatrics implemented the survey with technical assistance from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program. <br><br>The purpose of the KRDHS was to provide data to the MOH on factors which determine the health status of women and children such as fertility, contraception, induced abortion, maternal care, infant mortality, nutritional status, and anemia. <br><br>Some statistics presented in this report are currently available to the MOH from other sources.  For example, the MOH collects and regularly publishes information on fertility, contraception, induced abortion and infant mortality.  However, the survey presents information on these indices in a manner which is not currently available, i.e., by population subgroups such as those defined by age, marital duration, education, and ethnicity.  Additionally, the survey provides statistics on some issues not previously available in the Kyrgyz Republic: for example, breastfeeding practices and anemia status of women and children. When considered together, existing MOH data and the KRDHS data provide a more complete picture of the health conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic than was previously available.  <br><br>A secondary objective of the survey was to enhance the capabilities of institutions in the Kyrgyz Republic to collect, process, and analyze population and health data. <br><br>MAIN FINDINGS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Rates.  Survey results indicate a total fertility rate (TFR) for all of the Kyrgyz Republic of 3.4 children per woman.  Fertility levels differ for different population groups.  The TFR for women living in urban areas (2.3 children per woman) is substantially lower than for women living in rural areas (3.9). The TFR for Kyrgyz women (3.6 children per woman) is higher than for women of Russian ethnicity (1.5) but lower than Uzbek women (4.2).  Among the regions of the Kyrgyz Republic, the TFR is lowest in Bishkek City (1.7 children per woman), and the highest in the East Region (4.3), and intermediate in the North and South Regions (3.1 and3.9, respectively). <br><br>Time Trends. The KRDHS data show that fertility has declined in the Kyrgyz Republic in recent years.  The decline in fertility from 5-9 to 0-4 years prior to the survey increases with age, from an 8 percent decline among 20-24 year olds to a 38 percent decline among 35-39 year olds.  The declining trend in fertility can be seen by comparing the completed family size of women near the end of their childbearing years with the current TFR.  Completed family size among women 40-49 is 4.6 children which is more than one child greater than the current TFR (3.4). <br><br>Birth Intervals. Overall, 30 percent of births in the Kyrgyz Republic take place within 24 months of the previous birth. The median birth interval is 31.9 months. <br><br>Age at Onset of Childbearing. The median age at which women in the Kyrgyz Republic begin childbearing has been holding steady over the past two decades at approximately 21.6 years. Most women have their first birth while in their early twenties, although about 20 percent of women give birth before age 20. <br><br>Nearly half of married women in the Kyrgyz Republic (45 percent) do not want to have more children.  Additional one-quarter of women (26 percent) want to delay their next birth by at least two years. These are the women who are potentially in need of some method of family planning. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Ever Use.  Among currently married women, 83 percent report having used a method of contraception at some time.  The women most likely to have ever used a method of contraception are those age 30-44 (among both currently married and all women). <br><br>Current Use.  Overall, among currently married women, 60 percent report that they are currently using a contraceptive method.  About half (49 percent) are using a modern method of contraception and another 11 percent are using a traditional method.  The IUD is by far the most commonly used method; 38 percent of currently married women  are using the IUD.  Other modern methods of contraception account for only a small amount of use among currently married women: pills (2 percent), condoms (6 percent), and injectables and female sterilization (1 and 2 percent, respectively).  Thus, the practice of family planning in the Kyrgyz Republic places high reliance on a single method, the IUD.  <br><br>Source of Methods.  The vast majority of women obtain their contraceptives through the public sector (97 percent): 35 percent from a government hospital, and 36 percent from a women counseling center. The source of supply of the method depends on the method being used.  For example, most women using IUDs obtain them at women counseling centers (42 percent) or hospitals (39 percent).  Government pharmacies supply 46 percent of pill users and 75 percent of condom users.  Pill users also obtain supplies from women counseling centers or (33 percent).  <br><br>Fertility Preferences.  A majority of women in the Kyrgyz Republic (45 percent) indicated that they desire no more children.  By age 25-29, 20 percent want no more children, and by age 30-34, nearly half (46 percent) want no more children.  Thus, many women come to the preference to stop childbearing at relatively young ages-when they have 20 or more potential years of childbearing ahead of them.  For some of these women, the most appropriate method of contraception may be a long-acting method such as female sterilization.  However, there is a deficiency of use of this method in the Kyrgyz Republic.  In the interests of providing a broad range of safe and effective methods, information about and access to sterilization should be increased so that individual women can make informed decisions about using this method. <br><br>INDUCED ABORTION <br><br>Abortion Rates.  From the KRDHS data, the total abortion rate (TAR)-the number of abortions a woman will have in her lifetime based on the currently prevailing abortion rates-was calculated.  For the Kyrgyz Republic, the TAR for the period from mid-1994 to mid-1997 is 1.6 abortions per woman. The TAR for the Kyrgyz Republic is lower than recent estimates of the TAR for other areas of the former Soviet Union such as Kazakhstan (1.8), and Yekaterinburg and Perm in Russia (2.3 and 2.8, respectively), but higher than for Uzbekistan (0.7). <br><br>The TAR is higher in urban areas (2.1 abortions per woman) than in rural areas (1.3).  The TAR in Bishkek City is 2.0 which is two  times higher than in other regions of the Kyrgyz Republic.  Additionally the TAR is substantially lower among ethnic Kyrgyz women (1.3) than among women of Uzbek and Russian ethnicities (1.9 and 2.2 percent, respectively). <br><br>INFANT MORTALITY <br><br>In the KRDHS, infant mortality data were collected based on the international definition of a live birth which, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, is a birth that breathes or shows any sign of life (United Nations, 1992). <br>Mortality Rates.  For the five-year period before the survey (i.e., approximately mid-1992 to mid­1997), infant mortality in the Kyrgyz Republic is estimated at 61 infant deaths per 1,000 births.  The estimates of neonatal and postneonatal mortality are 32 and 30 per 1,000. <br><br>The MOH publishes infant mortality rates annually but the definition of a live birth used by the MOH differs from that used in the survey.  As is the case in most of the republics of the former Soviet Union, a pregnancy that terminates at less than 28 weeks of gestation is considered premature and is classified as a late miscarriage even if signs of life are present at the time of delivery. Thus, some events classified as late miscarriages in the MOH system would be classified as live births and infant deaths according to the definitions used in the KRDHS. <br><br>Infant mortality rates based on the MOH data for the years 1983 through 1996 show a persistent declining trend throughout the period, starting at about 40 per 1,000 in the early 1980s and declining to 26 per 1,000 in 1996.  This time trend is similar to that displayed by the rates estimated from the KRDHS. Thus, the estimates from both the KRDHS and the Ministry document a substantial decline in infant mortality; 25 percent over the period from 1982-87 to 1992-97 according to the KRDHS and 28 percent over the period from 1983-87 to 1993-96 according to the MOH estimates.  This is strong evidence of improvements in infant survivorship in recent years in the Kyrgyz Republic. <br><br>It should be noted that  the rates from the survey are much higher than the MOH rates. For example, the KRDHS estimate of 61 per 1,000 for the period 1992-97 is twice the MOH estimate of 29 per 1,000 for 1993-96.  Certainly, one factor leading to this difference are the differences in the definitions of a live birth and infant death in the KRDHS survey and in the MOH protocols.  A thorough assessment of the difference between the two  estimates would need to take into consideration the sampling variability of the survey's estimate.  However, given the magnitude of the difference, it is likely that it arises from a combination of definitional and methodological differences between the survey and MOH registration system. <br><br>MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH <br><br>The Kyrgyz Republic has a well-developed health system with an extensive infrastructure of facilities that provide maternal care services. This system includes special delivery hospitals, the obstetrics and gynecology departments of general hospitals, women counseling centers, and doctor's assistant/midwife posts (FAPs). There is an extensive network of FAPs throughout the rural areas. <br><br>Delivery.  Virtually all births in the Kyrgyz Republic (96 percent) are delivered at health facilities: 95 percent in delivery hospitals and another 1 percent in either general hospitals or FAPs.  Only 4 percent of births are delivered at home.  Almost all births (98 percent) are delivered under the supervision of medically trained persons: 61 percent by a doctor and 37 percent by a nurse or midwife. <br><br>Antenatal Care. As expected, the survey data indicate that a high proportion of respondents (97 percent) receive antenatal care from professional health providers: the majority from a doctor (65 percent) and a significant proportion from a nurse or midwife (32 percent).  The general pattern in the Kyrgyz Republic is that women seek antenatal care early and continue to receive care throughout their pregnancies. The median number of antenatal care visits reported by respondents is 8. <br><br>Immunization. Information on vaccination coverage was collected in the KRDHS for all children under three years of age.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, child health cards are maintained in the local health care facilities or day care centers rather than in the homes of respondents.  The vaccination data were obtained from the health cards in the health facilities or day care centers. <br><br>In the Kyrgyz Republic, the percentage of children 12-23 months of age who have received all World Health Organization (WHO) recommended vaccinations is high (82 percent).  BCG vaccination is usually given in delivery hospitals and was nearly universal (99 percent).  Almost all children (100 percent) have received the first doses of polio and DPT/DT.  Coverage for the second doses of polio and DPT/DT is also nearly universal (98 percent).  The third doses of polio and DPT/DT have been received by 95 percent of children.  This represents a dropout rate of 5 percent for both the polio and DPT/DT vaccinations.  A high proportion of children (85 percent) have received the measles vaccine. <br><br>NUTRITION <br><br>Breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding is almost universal in the Kyrgyz Republic; 95 percent of children born in the three years preceding the survey are breastfed.  Overall, 41 percent of children are breastfed within an hour of delivery and 65 percent within 24 hours of delivery. The median duration of breastfeeding is lengthy (16 months).  However, durations of exclusive and full breastfeeding, recommended by WHO, are short (2.1 and 2.9 months, respectively). <br><br>Supplementary feeding. Supplementary feeding starts early in the Kyrgyz Republic.  At age 0-3 months, 10 percent of  breastfeeding children are given infant formula and 13 percent are given powdered or evaporated milk.  By 4-7 months of age, 17 percent of breastfeeding children are given foods high in protein (meat, poultry, fish, and eggs) and 33 percent are given fruits or vegetables. <br><br>Nutritional Status. In the KRDHS, the height and weight of children under three years of age were measured.   These data are used to determine the proportion of children who are stunted (short for their age, a condition which may reflect chronic undernutrition) and the proportion who are wasted (underweight according to their height, a condition which may reflect an acute episode of undernutrition resulting from a recent illness). <br>In a well-nourished population of children, it is expected that about 2.3 percent of children will be measured as moderately or severely stunted or wasted.  For all of the Kyrgyz Republic, the survey found that 25 percent of children are severely or moderately stunted and 3 percent are severely or moderately wasted. <br><br>PREVALENCE OF ANEMIA <br><br>Testing of women and children for anemia was one of the major efforts of the 1997 KRDHS. Anemia has been considered a major public health problem in the Kyrgyz Republic for decades. Nevertheless, this was the first anemia study in the Kyrgyz Republic done on a national basis. The study involved hemoglobin (Hb) testing for anemia using the Hemocue system. <br>Women. Thirty-eight percent of the women in the Kyrgyz Republic suffer from some degree of anemia. The great majority of these women have either mild (28 percent) or moderate anemia (9 percent). One percent have severe anemia. <br><br>Children.  Fifty percent of children under the age of three suffer from some degree of anemia. Twenty-four percent have moderate anemia.  One percent of children are severely anemic. Thirty-two percent of the children living in the North Region and 24 percent of children living in the South and East Regions were diagnosed as having moderate or severe anemia.  In Bishkek City the prevalence of moderate anemia among children was relatively low (13 percent). <br><br>Certain relationships are observed between the prevalence of anemia among mothers and their children. Among children of mothers with moderate anemia, 0.5 percent have severe anemia and 37 percent have moderate anemia. The prevalence of moderate anemia among these children is more than twice as high as among children of non-anemic mothers.",0048742,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Kosovo - Living Standards Measurement Survey 2000,"Starting June 1999, after the intervention of NATO in the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia (FRY), the United Nations provided interim administration for the province. The consequences of the conflict on the living standards of the population were severe, with the collapse of the industrial sector, the paralysis of agriculture, and extensive damage to private housing, education and health facilities and other infrastructure. In addition, the conflict brought massive population displacement both within Kosovo and abroad.<br><br>A year later, Kosovo was in a process of transition from emergency relief to long-term economic development.

Children age 2 years and older as well as adults were tested for HIV. <br><br>The principal objective of the 2006-07 Swaziland Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS) was to provide up-to-date information on fertility, childhood mortality, marriage, fertility preferences, awareness, and use of family planning methods, infant feeding practices, maternal and child health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and behaviour and prevalence of HIV and anaemia. <br><br>More specifically the 2006-07 SDHS was aimed at achieving the following; <br>- Determine key demographic rates, particularly fertility, under-five mortality, and adult mor­tality rates <br>- Investigate the direct and indirect factors which determine the level and trends of fertility <br>- Measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method <br>- Determine immunization coverage and prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and acute res­piratory diseases among children under five <br>- Determine infant and young child feeding practices and assess the nutritional status of chil­dren 6-59 months, women age 15-49 years, and men aged 15-49 years <br>- Estimate prevalence of anaemia <br>- Assess knowledge and attitudes of women and men regarding sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use <br>- Identify behaviours that protect or predispose the population to HIV infection <br>- Examine social, economic, and cultural determinants of HIV  <br>- Determine the proportion of households with orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) <br>- Determine the proportion of households with sick people taken care at household level <br>- Determine HIV prevalence among males and females age 2 years and older <br>- Determine the use of iodized salt in households <br>- Describe care and protection of children age 12-14 years, and their knowledge and attitudes about sex and HIV/AIDS. <br><br>This information is intended to provide data to assist policymakers and programme implementers to monitor and evaluate existing programmes and to design new strategies for demographic, social and health policies in Swaziland. The survey also provides data to monitor the country's achievement towards the Millenium Development Goals.<br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Fertility in Swaziland has been declining ra­pidly, with the TFR falling from 6.4 births per woman in 1986 to 3.8 births at the time of the SDHS. As expected, fertility is higher in rural areas (4.2 births per woman) than in urban areas (3.0 births per woman). Fertility differentials by education and wealth are substantial. Women with no education have on average 4.9 children compared with 2.4 children for women with tertiary education. Fertility varies widely according to household wealth. Women in the highest wealth quintile have 2.9 chil­dren fewer than women in the lowest quintile (2.6 and 5.5 births per woman, respectively). <br><br>- Knowledge of family planning is universal in Swaziland. The most widely known method is the male condom (99 percent for both males and females). Among women, other widely known methods include injectables (96 percent), the pill (95 percent), and the female condom (91 per­cent). For men, the best known methods besides the male condom are the female condom (94 percent) and the pill and injectables (84 percent each).<br><br>- Children are considered fully vaccinated when they receive one dose of BCG vaccine, three doses each of DPT and polio vaccines, and one dose of measles vaccine. BCG coverage among children age 12-23 months is nearly uni­versal (97 percent); coverage is also high for the first doses of DPT (96 percent) and polio (97 percent). The proportion of children receiving subsequent do­ses of DPT and polio vaccines drops slightly, with 92 percent of children receiving the third dose of DPT and 87 percent receiving the third dose of polio. Ninety-two percent of children had received a mea­sles vaccination by the time of the SDHS. Overall, 82 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully im­munised.<br><br>- In Swaziland, almost all women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from health professionals (97 percent); 9 percent received care from a doctor, and 88 percent received care from a trained nurse or midwife. Only 3 percent of mothers did not receive any antenatal care<br><br>- Overall, 87 percent of children in Swaziland are breastfed for some period of time (ever breastfed). The median duration of any breast-feeding in Swaziland is almost 17 months. How­ever, the median duration of exclusive breast-feeding is much shorter (0.7 months).<br><br>- In interpreting the malaria programme indicators in Swaziland, it is important to recognise that the dis­ease affects an estimated 30 percent of the population where malaria is most prevalent (the Lubombo Pla­teau, the lowveld, and parts of the middleveld). Malaria is also seasonal, occurring mainly during or after the rainy season (from November to March). A substantial part of the SDHS field­work took place outside of this period. <br><br>- Results from the HIV testing component in the 2006-07 SDHS indicate that 26 percent of Swazi adults age 15-49 are infected with HIV. Among women, the HIV rate is 31 percent, com­pared with 20 percent among men. HIV preva­lence peaks at 49 percent for women age 25-29, which is almost five times the rate among wo­men age 15-19 and more than twice the rate ob­served among women age 45-49. HIV preva­lence increases from 2 percent among men in the 15-19 age group to 45 percent in the age group 35-39 and then decreases to 28 percent among men age 45-49. HIV prevalence for women and men age 50 or over is 12 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Among the population age 2-14 years, 4 percent of girls and boys are infected.",0048696,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Eswatini - Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2010,"This report presents results of the 2010 the Kingdom of Eswatini MICS, carried out by CSO in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners.

Kenya - Demographic and Health Survey 1998,"The 1998 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 7,881 women age 15-49 and 3,407 men age 15-54. The KDHS was implemented by the National Council for Population and Development (NCPD) and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), with significant technical and logistical support provided by the Ministry of Health and various other governmental and non­governmental organizations in Kenya.  Macro International Inc. of Calverton, Maryland (U.S.A.) provided technical assistance throughout the course of the project in the context of the worldwide Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, while financial assistance was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/Nairobi) and the Department for International Development (DFID/U.K.). Data collection for the KDHS was conducted from February to July 1998. <br><br>Like the previous KDHS surveys conducted in 1989 and 1993, the 1998 KDHS was designed to provide information on levels and trends in fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality, and other maternal and child health indicators.  However, the 1998 KDHS went further to collect more in-depth data on knowledge and behaviours related to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), detailed “calendar” data that allows estimation of contraceptive discontinuation rates, and information related to the practice of female circumcision. Further, unlike earlier surveys, the 1998 KDHS provides a national estimate of the level of maternal mortality (i.e. related to pregnancy and childbearing). The KDHS data are intended for use by programme managers and policymakers to evaluate and improve health and family planning programmes in Kenya. <br><br>OBJECTIVES OF THE SURVEY <br><br>The principal aim of the 1998 KDHS project is to provide up-to-date information on fertility and childhood mortality levels, nuptiality, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, use of maternal and child health services, and knowledge and behaviours related to HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases.  It was designed as a follow-on to the 1989 KDHS and 1993 KDHS, national-level surveys of similar size and scope. Ultimately, the 1998 KDHS project seeks to: <br><br>- Assess the overall demographic situation in Kenya;<br>- Assist in the evaluation of the population and reproductive health programmes in Kenya; <br>- Advance survey methodology; and <br>- Assist the NCPD to strengthen its capacity to conduct demographic and health surveys. <br><br>The 1998 KDHS was specifically designed to: <br>- Provide data on the family planning and fertility behaviour of the Kenyan population, and to thereby enable the NCPD to evaluate and enhance the national family planning programme; <br>- Measure changes in fertility and contraceptive prevalence and at the same time study the factors which affect these changes, such as marriage patterns, desire for children, availability of contraception, breastfeeding habits, and important social and economic factors; <br>- Examine the basic indicators of maternal and child health in Kenya, including nutritional status, use of antenatal and maternity services, treatment of recent episodes of childhood illness, and use of immunisation services; <br>- Describe levels and patterns of knowledge and behaviour related to the prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infection; <br>- Measure adult and maternal mortality at the national level; and <br>- Ascertain the extent and pattern of female circumcision in the country. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>Fertility.  The survey results demonstrate a continuation of the fertility transition in Kenya.  Marriage.  The age at which women and men first marry has risen slowly over the past 20 years. Fertility Preferences.  Fifty-three percent of women and 46 percent of men in Kenya do not want to have any more children.  Family Planning.  Knowledge and use of family planning in Kenya has continued to rise over the last several years.  Early Childhood Mortality.  Results from the 1998 KDHS data make clear that childhood mortality conditions have worsened in the early-mid 1990s;Maternal Health.  Utilisation of antenatal services is high in Kenya; in the three years before the survey, mothers received antenatal care for 92 percent of births (Note: These data do not speak to the quality of those antenatal services).  Childhood Immunisation. The KDHS found that 65 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated: this includes BCG and measles vaccine, and at least 3 doses of both DPT and polio vaccines. Infant Feeding.  Almost all children (98 percent) are breastfed for some period of time; however, only 58 percent are breastfed within the first hour of life, and 86 percent within the first day after birth. Nutritional Status The results indicate that one-third of children in Kenya are stunted (i.e., too short for their age), a condition reflecting chronic malnutrition; and 1 in 16 children are wasted (i.e., very thin), a problem indicating acute or short-term food deficit.  <br><br>Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections.  As a measure of the increasing toll taken by AIDS on Kenyan society, the percentage of respondents who reported “personally knowing someone who has AIDS or has died from AIDS” has risen from about 40 percent of men and women in the 1993 KDHS to nearly three-quarters of men and women in 1998. Female Circumcision. The results indicate that 38 percent of women age 15-49 in Kenya have been circumcised.  The prevalence of FC has however declined significantly over the last 2 decades from about one-half of women in the oldest age cohorts to about one-quarter of women in the youngest cohorts (including daughters age 15+).",0048678,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

The survey will go a long way in encouraging increased demand for use of statistics by policy makers at devolved levels and will ensure that resources at both county and national levels are used most effectively through well-planned projects/programs that will benefit especially the women and children of the three counties. The MICS5 results were critical in gauging milestones achieved in the field of education, nutrition, child development, health for women and children in the three counties and in evaluating the various health based policies that the government has formulated over the years towards achieving the national welfare objectives.<br><br>The 2013-14 MICS5 data was critical in informing the future planning for the three counties, especially in view of the new constitutional dispensation and Vision 2030.

Kenya - Estimating the Impacts of Microfranchising on Young Women in Nairobi 2013-2015,"This research evaluates the impact of an intervention to provide microfranchising opportunities to young women in Nairobi, Kenya. The research aims to measure the direct impact of a microfranchising intervention on program participants and the indirect impacts of the program on pre-existing businesses in the area of the intervention. <br><br>To measure the direct impact on program participants, the research conducts two surveys of participants in the second wave of a micofranchising program being implemented by in six Nairobi neighborhoods. The two surveys comprise: a baseline survey of applicants who will subsequently be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control (non-treated comparison) group and an endline impact evaluation survey of up to 2000 women who complete the baseline survey. The two treatment groups are designed to compare the relative impact of access to the microfranchising opportunity and access to a cash grant of comparable value. The research will focus on the impact of the treatment opportunities on young women’s labor supply, income and expenditures, savings, empowerment and self-actualization, and overall well-being. <br><br>To measure the indirect impact on pre-existing businesses, the research project also includes an enterprise census and a monthly enterprise survey. The census will identify businesses operating in the sectors and neighborhoods of interest, a subset of whom will then be invited to join the enterprise survey.

Kenya - Hunger Safety Net Programme Survey 2016,"The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) is a social protection project being conducted in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) of northern Kenya. The ASALs are extremely food-insecure areas highly prone to drought, which have experienced recurrent food crises and food aid responses for decades. The HSNP is intended to reduce dependency on emergency food aid by sustainably strengthening livelihoods through cash transfers. The pilot phase ran from 2009 to 2013. The second phase has been launched in July 2013 and contracted to run until March 2018. Oxford Policy Management (OPM) was responsible for the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the programme under the pilot phase, as well as the second phase of implementation. <br><br>Within the impact evaluation component for Phase 2, OPM used a range of analytical methods within an overarching mixed-method approach. The quantitative impact evaluation of HSNP Phase 2 compares the situation of HSNP2 beneficiaries and control households, relying on the Regression Discountinuity approach, integrated by a targeted Propensity Score Matching approach. In addition to the analysis at the household level, a Local Economy-Wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) was conducted to investigate the impact of the HSNP2 on the local economy, including on the production activities of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households.<br><br>A single round of data collection based on a household and business survey underpins the household quantitative impact evaluation and the LEWIE study. The objective of the survey is to collect household and business data to provide an assessment of the programme's impact on the local economy, as well as beneficiary households. <br><br>The household survey is a survey of 5,979 people, carried out between 13 February and 29 June 2016 in 187 sub-locations across the four counties of Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana and Wajir. The survey covered modules on household demographic characteristics, livestock, assets, land, transfers, food and non-food consumption, food security, saving and borrowing, jobs, business, livestock trading and subjective poverty.  <br><br>In addition to the household survey, a business questionnaire was conducted in the three main commercial hubs of each county. Overall, 282 business questionnaires were administered in the four counties. The purpose of the survey was to learn more about local economic activities and livelihoods in the HSNP counties, and the data was used for the LEWIE analysis. The aim was to capture information on three main sectors of the local economy:<br>-	Retailing - shops that sell retail goods on which a price mark-up is applied;<br>-	Services;<br>-	Producers - businesses that transform inputs into outputs.<br><br>Lastly, since livestock trading is a very important activity in the HSNP counties, livestock traders have been interviewed to understand better how the market works.

Indonesia - Family Life Survey 1997,"By the middle of the 1990s, Indonesia had enjoyed over three decades of remarkable social, economic, and demographic change and was on the cusp of joining the middle-income countries. Per capita income had risen more than fifteenfold since the early 1960s, from around US$50 to more than US$800. Increases in educational attainment and decreases in fertility and infant mortality over the same period reflected impressive investments in infrastructure.<br><br>In the late 1990s the economic outlook began to change as Indonesia was gripped by the economic crisis that affected much of Asia. In 1998 the rupiah collapsed, the economy went into a tailspin, and gross domestic product contracted by an estimated 12-15%-a decline rivaling the magnitude of the Great Depression.<br><br>The general trend of several decades of economic progress followed by a few years of economic downturn masks considerable variation across the archipelago in the degree both of economic development and of economic setbacks related to the crisis. In part this heterogeneity reflects the great cultural and ethnic diversity of Indonesia, which in turn makes it a rich laboratory for research on a number of individual- and household-level behaviors and outcomes that interest social scientists.<br><br>The Indonesia Family Life Survey is designed to provide data for studying behaviors and outcomes. The survey contains a wealth of information collected at the individual and household levels, including multiple indicators of economic and non-economic well-being: consumption, income, assets, education, migration, labor market outcomes, marriage, fertility, contraceptive use, health status, use of health care and health insurance, relationships among co-resident and non- resident family members, processes underlying household decision-making, transfers among family members and participation in community activities. In addition to individual- and household-level information, the IFLS provides detailed information from the communities in which IFLS households are located and from the facilities that serve residents of those communities. These data cover aspects of the physical and social environment, infrastructure, employment opportunities, food prices, access to health and educational facilities, and the quality and prices of services available at those facilities. By linking data from IFLS households to data from their communities, users can address many important questions regarding the impact of policies on the lives of the respondents, as well as document the effects of social, economic, and environmental change on the population.<br><br>The Indonesia Family Life Survey complements and extends the existing survey data available for Indonesia, and for developing countries in general, in a number of ways.<br><br>First, relatively few large-scale longitudinal surveys are available for developing countries. IFLS is the only large-scale longitudinal survey available for Indonesia. Because data are available for the same individuals from multiple points in time, IFLS affords an opportunity to understand the dynamics of behavior, at the individual, household and family and community levels. In IFLS1 7,224 households were interviewed, and detailed individual-level data were collected from over 22,000 individuals. In IFLS2, 94.4% of IFLS1 households were re-contacted (interviewed or died). In IFLS3 the re-contact rate was 95.3% of IFLS1 households. Indeed nearly 91% of IFLS1 households are complete panel households in that they were interviewed in all three waves, IFLS1, 2 and 3. These re-contact rates are as high as or higher than most longitudinal surveys in the United States and Europe.

India - National Family Health Survey 1992-1993,"The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) was carried out as the principal activity of a collaborative project to strengthen the research capabilities of the Population Reasearch Centres (PRCs) in India, initiated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, and coordinated by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Bombay. Interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of 89,777 ever-married women in the age group 13-49, from 24 states and the National Capital Territoty of Delhi. The main objective of the survey was to collect reliable and up-to-date information on fertility, family planning, mortality, and maternal and child health. Data collection was carried out in three phases from April 1992 to September 1993. THe NFHS is one of the most complete surveys of its kind ever conducted in India.<br><br>The households covered in the survey included 500,492 residents. The young age structure of the population highlights the momentum of the future population growth of the country; 38 percent of household residents are under age 15, with their reproductive years still in the future. Persons age 60 or older constitute 8 percent of the population. The population sex ratio of the de jure residents is 944 females per 1,000 males, which is slightly higher than sex ratio of 927 observed in the 1991 Census.<br><br>The primary objective of the NFHS is to provide national-level and state-level data on fertility, nuptiality, family size preferences, knowledge and practice of family planning, the potentiel demand for contraception, the level of unwanted fertility, utilization of antenatal services, breastfeeding and food supplemation practises, child nutrition and health, immunizations, and infant and child mortality. The NFHS is also designed to explore the demographic and socioeconomic determinants of fertility, family planning, and maternal and child health. This information is intended to assist policymakers, adminitrators and researchers in assessing and evaluating population and family welfare programmes and strategies. The NFHS used uniform questionnaires and uniform methods of sampling, data collection and analysis with the primary objective of providing a source of demographic and health data for interstate comparisons.

India - National Family Health Survey 1998-1999,"The second National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2), conducted in 1998-99, provides information on fertility, mortality, family planning, and important aspects of nutrition, health, and health care. The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) coordinated the survey, which collected information from a nationally representative sample of more than 90,000 ever-married women age 15-49. The NFHS-2 sample covers 99 percent of India's population living in all 26 states. This report is based on the survey data for 25 of the 26 states, however, since data collection in Tripura was delayed due to local problems in the state. <br><br>IIPS also coordinated the first National Family Health Survey (NFHS-1) in 1992-93. Most of the types of information collected in NFHS-2 were also collected in the earlier survey, making it possible to identify trends over the intervening period of six and one-half years. In addition, the NFHS-2 questionnaire covered a number of new or expanded topics with important policy implications, such as reproductive health, women's autonomy, domestic violence, women's nutrition, anaemia, and salt iodization. <br><br>The NFHS-2 survey was carried out in two phases. Ten states were surveyed in the first phase which began in November 1998 and the remaining states (except Tripura) were surveyed in the second phase which began in March 1999. The field staff collected information from 91,196 households in these 25 states and interviewed 89,199 eligible women in these households. In addition, the survey collected information on 32,393 children born in the three years preceding the survey. One health investigator on each survey team measured the height and weight of eligible women and children and took blood samples to assess the prevalence of anaemia. <br><br>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS <br><br>POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS <br><br>Three-quarters (73 percent) of the population lives in rural areas. The age distribution is typical of populations that have recently experienced a fertility decline, with relatively low proportions in the younger and older age groups. Thirty-six percent of the population is below age 15, and 5 percent is age 65 and above. The sex ratio is 957 females for every 1,000 males in rural areas but only 928 females for every 1,000 males in urban areas, suggesting that more men than women have migrated to urban areas. <br><br>The survey provides a variety of demographic and socioeconomic background information. In the country as a whole, 82 percent of household heads are Hindu, 12 percent are Muslim, 3 percent are Christian, and 2 percent are Sikh. Muslims live disproportionately in urban areas, where they comprise 15 percent of household heads. Nineteen percent of household heads belong to scheduled castes, 9 percent belong to scheduled tribes, and 32 percent belong to other backward classes (OBCs). Two-fifths of household heads do not belong to any of these groups. <br><br>Questions about housing conditions and the standard of living of households indicate some improvements since the time of NFHS-1. Sixty percent of households in India now have electricity and 39 percent have piped drinking water compared with 51 percent and 33 percent, respectively, at the time of NFHS-1. Sixty-four percent of households have no toilet facility compared with 70 percent at the time of NFHS-1. <br><br>About three-fourths (75 percent) of males and half (51 percent) of females age six and above are literate, an increase of 6-8 percentage points from literacy rates at the time of NFHS-1. The percentage of illiterate males varies from 6-7 percent in Mizoram and Kerala to 37 percent in Bihar and the percentage of illiterate females varies from 11 percent in Mizoram and 15 percent in Kerala to 65 percent in Bihar. Seventy-nine percent of children age 6-14 are attending school, up from 68 percent in NFHS-1. The proportion of children attending school has increased for all ages, particularly for girls, but girls continue to lag behind boys in school attendance. Moreover, the disparity in school attendance by sex grows with increasing age of children. At age 6-10, 85 percent of boys attend school compared with 78 percent of girls. By age 15-17, 58 percent of boys attend school compared with 40 percent of girls. The percentage of girls 6-17 attending school varies from 51 percent in Bihar and 56 percent in Rajasthan to over 90 percent in Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. <br><br>Women in India tend to marry at an early age. Thirty-four percent of women age 15-19 are already married including 4 percent who are married but gauna has yet to be performed. These proportions are even higher in the rural areas. Older women are more likely than younger women to have married at an early age: 39 percent of women currently age 45-49 married before age 15 compared with 14 percent of women currently age 15-19. Although this indicates that the proportion of women who marry young is declining rapidly, half the women even in the age group 20-24 have married before reaching the legal minimum age of 18 years. On average, women are five years younger than the men they marry. The median age at marriage varies from about 15 years in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh to 23 years in Goa. <br><br>As part of an increasing emphasis on gender issues, NFHS-2 asked women about their participation in household decisionmaking. In India, 91 percent of women are involved in decision-making on at least one of four selected topics. A much lower proportion (52 percent), however, are involved in making decisions about their own health care. There are large variations among states in India with regard to women's involvement in household decisionmaking. More than three out of four women are involved in decisions about their own health care in Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Punjab compared with about two out of five or less in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Rajasthan. Thirty-nine percent of women do work other than housework, and more than two-thirds of these women work for cash. Only 41 percent of women who earn cash can decide independently how to spend the money that they earn. Forty-three percent of working women report that their earnings constitute at least half of total family earnings, including 18 percent who report that the family is entirely dependent on their earnings. Women's work-participation rates vary from 9 percent in Punjab and 13 percent in Haryana to 60-70 percent in Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh. <br><br>FERTILITY AND FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Fertility continues to decline in India. At current fertility levels, women will have an average of 2.9 children each throughout their childbearing years. The total fertility rate (TFR) is down from 3.4 children per woman at the time of NFHS-1, but is still well above the replacement level of just over two children per woman. There are large variations in fertility among the states in India. Goa and Kerala have attained below replacement level fertility and Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab are at or close to replacement level fertility. By contrast, fertility is 3.3 or more children per woman in Meghalaya, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Nagaland, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh. More than one-third to less than half of all births in these latter states are fourth or higher-order births compared with 7-9 percent of births in Kerala, Goa, and Tamil Nadu. <br><br>Efforts to encourage the trend towards lower fertility might usefully focus on groups within the population that have higher fertility than average. In India, rural women and women from scheduled tribes and scheduled castes have somewhat higher fertility than other women, but fertility is particularly high for illiterate women, poor women, and Muslim women. Another striking feature is the high level of childbearing among young women. More than half of women age 20-49 had their first birth before reaching age 20, and women age 15-19 account for almost one-fifth of total fertility. Studies in India and elsewhere have shown that health and mortality risks increase when women give birth at such young ages?both for the women themselves and for their children. Family planning programmes focusing on women in this age group could make a significant impact on maternal and child health and help to reduce fertility. <br><br>INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY<br><br>NFHS-2 provides estimates of infant and child mortality and examines factors associated with the survival of young children. During the five years preceding the survey, the infant mortality rate was 68 deaths at age 0-11 months per 1,000 live births, substantially lower than 79 per 1,000 in the five years preceding the NFHS-1 survey. The child mortality rate, 29 deaths at age 1-4 years per 1,000 children reaching age one, also declined from the corresponding rate of 33 per 1,000 in NFHS-1. Ninety-five children out of 1,000 born do not live to age five years. Expressed differently, 1 in 15 children die in the first year of life, and 1 in 11 die before reaching age five. Child-survival programmes might usefully focus on specific groups of children with particularly high infant and child mortality rates, such as children who live in rural areas, children whose mothers are illiterate, children belonging to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes, and children from poor households. Infant mortality rates are more than two and one-half times as high for women who did not receive any of the recommended types of maternity related medical care than for mothers who did receive all recommended types of care. <br><br>HEALTH, HEALTH CARE, AND NUTRITION<br><br>Promotion of maternal and child health has been one of the most important components of the Family Welfare Programme of the Government of India. One goal is for each pregnant woman to receive at least three antenatal check-ups plus two tetanus toxoid injections and a full course of iron and folic acid supplementation. In India, mothers of 65 percent of the children born in the three years preceding NFHS-2 received at least one antenatal check-up and 44 percent received at least three check-ups. For 67 percent of these births, mothers received the recommended number of tetanus toxoid vaccinations during pregnancy, up from 54 percent in NFHS-1. For 58 percent, mothers received iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. Women in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups are less likely than other women to be covered by each of these interventions. Coverage is also low for women who already have four or more children. States that perform well below the national average with regard to the provision of recommended components of antenatal care include Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and several of the northeastern states. Kerala, Goa, and Tamil Nadu, by contrast, have achieved relative success with regard to antenatal care. In these states, mothers of over 90 percent of births receive at least three antenatal check-ups, at least 86 percent receive two or more tetanus toxoid injections, and at least 93 percent receive iron and folic acid tablets. Even in these states, however, a substantial proportion of women do not receive all of the recommended components of antenatal care. <br><br>NFHS-2 collected information on the prevalence and treatment of three health problems that cause considerable mortality in young children?fever, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhoea. In India 30 percent of children under age three had fever during the two weeks preceding the survey, 19 percent had symptoms of ARI, and 19 percent had diarrhoea. About two-thirds of the children who had symptoms of ARI or diarrhoea were taken to a health facility or health-care provider. Knowledge of the appropriate treatment of diarrhoea remains low. Only 62 percent of mothers of children age less than 3 years know about oral rehydration salt (ORS) packets and 34 percent of mothers incorrectly believe that children should be given less to drink than usual when sick with diarrhoea. Forty-eight percent of children with diarrhoea received some form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), including 27 percent who received ORS. The percentage of children with diarrhoea who received ORS has increased substantially since NFHS-1, when it was only 18 percent, suggesting some improvement in the management of childhood diarrhoea. Among children sick with diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to the survey, the proportion who were given some form of ORT varies from 90 percent in Kerala, 76 percent in Goa, and 73 percent in West Bengal to 34 percent in Rajasthan and 36 percent in Uttar Pradesh. The proportion given ORS varies from 56 percent in Goa and 51 percent in Manipur to only 15-16 percent in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. <br><br>Although the spread of HIV/AIDS is a major concern in India, 60 percent of women in India have not heard of AIDS. Awareness of AIDS is particularly low among women who are not regularly exposed to media, scheduled-tribe women, illiterate women, women living in households with a low standard of living, and rural women. Among women who have heard of AIDS, 79 percent learned about the disease from television and 42 percent from radio, suggesting that the government's efforts to promote AIDS awareness through the electronic mass media have achieved some success. Among women who have heard of AIDS, however, one-third do not know of any way to avoid infection. Survey results suggest that health personnel could play a much larger role in promoting AIDS awareness. In India, only 4 percent of women who know about AIDS learned about the disease from a health worker. Only 12 percent of women have heard of AIDS in Bihar and 20-23 percent in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, compared with 87 percent or more in Mizoram, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Among women who have heard of AIDS, at least one-fourth do not know of any way to avoid it in all states except Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, and Delhi. These results suggest the need for effective IEC strategies throughout India.",0048395,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

India - National Family Health Survey 2005-2006,"The National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) programme, initiated in the early 1990s, has emerged as a nationally important source of data on population, health, and nutrition for India and its states. The 2005-06 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3), the third in the series of these national surveys, was preceded by NFHS-1 in 1992-93 and NFHS-2 in 1998-99. Like NFHS-1 and NFHS-2, NFHS-3 was designed to provide estimates of important indicators on family welfare, maternal and child health, and nutrition. In addition, NFHS-3 provides information on several new and emerging issues, including family life education, safe injections, perinatal mortality, adolescent reproductive health, high-risk sexual behaviour, tuberculosis, and malaria. Further, unlike the earlier surveys in which only ever-married women age 15-49 were eligible for individual interviews, NFHS-3 interviewed all women age 15-49 and all men age 15­-54. Information on nutritional status, including the prevalence of anaemia, is provided in NFHS­3 for women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and young children. <br><br>A special feature of NFHS-3 is the inclusion of testing of the adult population for HIV. NFHS-3 is the first nationwide community-based survey in India to provide an estimate of HIV prevalence in the general population. Specifically, NFHS-3 provides estimates of HIV prevalence among women age 15-49 and men age 15-54 for all of India, and separately for Uttar Pradesh and for Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, and Tamil Nadu, five out of the six states classified by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) as high HIV prevalence states. No estimate of HIV prevalence is being provided for Nagaland, the sixth high HIV prevalence state, due to strong local opposition to the collection of blood samples. <br><br>NFHS-3 covered all 29 states in India, which comprise more than 99 percent of India's population. NFHS-3 is designed to provide estimates of key indicators for India as a whole and, with the exception of HIV prevalence, for all 29 states by urban-rural residence. Additionally, NFHS-3 provides estimates for the slum and non-slum populations of eight cities, namely Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata, Meerut, Mumbai, and Nagpur. NFHS-3 was conducted under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, and is the result of the collaborative efforts of a large number of organizations. The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, was designated by MOHFW as the nodal agency for the project. Funding for NFHS-3 was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), DFID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, UNFPA, and MOHFW. Macro International, USA, provided technical assistance at all stages of the NFHS-3 project. NACO and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) provided technical assistance for the HIV component of NFHS-3. Eighteen Research Organizations, including six Population Research Centres, shouldered the responsibility of conducting the survey in the different states of India and producing electronic data files. <br><br>The survey used a uniform sample design, questionnaires (translated into 18 Indian languages), field procedures, and procedures for biomarker measurements throughout the country to facilitate comparability across the states and to ensure the highest possible data quality. The contents of the questionnaires were decided through an extensive collaborative process in early 2005. Based on provisional data, two national-level fact sheets and 29 state fact sheets that provide estimates of more than 50 key indicators of population, health, family welfare, and nutrition have already been released. The basic objective of releasing fact sheets within a very short period after the completion of data collection was to provide immediate feedback to planners and programme managers on key process indicators.",0048388,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

India - Micro Investment Climate Survey 2006,"This research is part of India 2006 Investment Climate Survey initiative that focused on enterprises in the manufacturing, retail, micro (unorganized), and software/information technology sectors. A separate survey was conducted for each sector. <br><br>India 2006 Micro Investment Climate Survey targeted establishments with 10 or fewer full-time paid employees. The research covered 1549 manufacturing enterprises from Delhi, Ludhiana, Mumbai, Thane, Howrah and Hyderabad. The following industries were surveyed: auto components, drugs and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electrical goods, electronics, food processing, garments, leather, textiles, metal and machine tools. <br><br>Unorganized (micro) manufacturing employs the vast majority of India's manufacturing workforce. Unorganized manufacturing firms are not integrated into the supply chain, thus limiting the transfer of technology. Possibly due to the legacy of the small scale reservation policy, much of the manufacturing activity in the unorganized sector is geared toward producing final products for the consumer market, rather than intermediate products and parts for the organized sector.<br><br>Being part of the organized sector, often referred to as the “formal sector,” increases a firm's bargaining power (for example, it has easier access to finance). However, international experience suggests that despite the advantages, unorganized enterprises often wish to remain informal, because organized firms are subject to more regulations. In India, the 10-worker threshold is especially important because labor laws on wages and benefits are applied to units above this size. Firms can avoid being part of the organized sector in two ways: operating “under the radar” by simply not registering, or by not growing.<br><br>The Investment Climate Surveys (ICS) collected information on the investment climate constraints the sectors faced, such as infrastructure, access to land, relationship with the court system, crime, government administration, use of financial services, and labor force. In addition, the surveys collected basic information on the firms, such as ownership structure, number of years of operations, and revenues and costs. The data and results from the ICS were intended to help develop policy reforms that would further promote growth and productivity of firms in India.",0048384,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Honduras - Farmer Training and Development 2008-2011,"The evaluation design for this activity changed over the course of the evaluation due to problems faced during implementation. In its original conception, the independent evaluator, NORC, and MCA-Honduras planned to use a randomized experimental design involving randomized assignment of communities (aldeas) to treatment. Following a series of implementation problems, the final approach used was an econometric model that relied on a model-based approach to impact evaluation.  <br>As raised in the evaluator report, one key assumption is that the causal models are correct. This is based on the assumption that all important unobserved variables affecting selection, such as proven ex-ante ability to grow horticultural crops, are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds). <br><br>Assumptions of the econometric model are:<br>1. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA, no macro effects assumption, partial equilibrium assumption) is made. This means that the effect (potential outcomes) on one individual are not affected by potential changes in the treatment exposure of other individuals. This implies, for example, that the program is not so large that the outcomes are correlated (e.g., that farmers would produce such a large amount of horticultural crops that the market would collapse). <br>2. The causal models are correct. The key assumption here is that all important unobserved variables affecting selection are time invariant (i.e., are constant between the two survey rounds). <br>3. The program intervention represents a “forced change” in (experimental control of) the agricultural system in Honduras.<br>4. The half of the country treated before this evaluation began is similar to the half yet to be treated, with respect to relationships among the important causal variables represented in the causal model underlying the statistical analysis. <br><br>The exposure period was 12-36 months. <br><br>Results from the final evaluation report include: the Model-based approach estimated net income change from horticultural crops is on average USD 600 higher for program participants than for nonparticipants. Input expenditures on these crops increased far more than they did for basic crops, implying a higher level of activity in cultivation of high value crops among program farmers. The results suggest a corresponding decline among program farmers in income from basic crops, as might be expected with changing crop mix; however, this decline is not statistically significant.<br>However, the program also did not appear to have had a positive effect on the proportion of farmers growing horticultural crops. This could well be because the implementer primarily chose as program participants farmers who showed a proven ability to grow horticultural crops. It is likely that increments in income from horticultural crops came from increased production among farmers already growing horticultural crops and not from farmers who switched over for the first time.<br><br>Even though there was an increase in income from horticultural crops, the evaluator did not find a corresponding statistically significant increase in net household income or household expenditures/consumption, as might have been expected.",0048334,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Haiti - Enquête Mortalité, Morbidité et Utilisation des Services 2000","L'EMMUS-III, réalisée en Haïti entre février et juillet 2000 à partir d'un échantillon représentatif au niveau national, a permis d'estimer le niveau de nombreux indicateurs démographiques et de santé. Ils fournissent des informations couvrant les domaines suivants : fécondité, planification familiale, avortement, mortalité maternelle, mortalité infanto-juvénile, santé reproductive, santé des enfants, statut nutritionnel des femmes et  des enfants, statut de la femme, violence domestique, IST/SIDA, disponibilité et utilisation des services. <br><br>L'EMMUS-III est basée sur un échantillon représentatif au niveau national, par grappe et stratifié à deux degrés. Il comprenait 317 grappes couvrant 9595 ménages, 10159 femmes de 15-­49 ans et 3171 hommes de 15-59 ans enquêtés avec succès. <br><br>L'EMMUS-III a suivi une méthodologie déjà utilisée avec succès dans de nombreuses enquêtes, ce qui garantit la fiabilité des résultats en termes de validité interne et externe. Néanmoins, il faut rappeler que les réponses fournies par les enquêtés(es) ne sont pas toujours exemptes d'un certain biais compte tenu de la défaillance de la mémoire, de la difficulté de certaines questions et de certains tabous culturels. Pour faire face à ces problèmes, un soin particulier a été consacré à la conception du questionnaire, en particulier dans sa version créole et aux techniques d'interview. <br><br>Enfin, il est important de rappeler que, comme dans toute enquête par sondage, du fait des erreurs de sondage, les valeurs des différents indicateurs se situent toujours dans une fourchette, appelée intervalle de confiance. Les intervalles de confiance ont été calculés pour les principaux indicateurs aux niveaux national, métropolitain, urbain et rural. <br><br>L'EMMUS-III avait pour objectifs d'estimer de nombreux indicateurs socio-économiques, démographiques et sanitaires au niveau de l'ensemble de la population et au niveau des sous-populations de femmes de 15-49 ans, des enfants de moins de 5 ans et des hommes de 15-59 ans. En particulier, l'EMMUS-III visait à identifier et/ou à estimer :<br><br>Pour l'ensemble de la population :<br>- les niveaux de scolarisation ;<br>- les niveaux de disponibilité et d'utilisation des services de santé ;<br>- les niveaux d'utilisation du sel iodé ;<br>- certains indicateurs de bien-être des ménages.<br><br>Pour les femmes de 15-49 ans et les enfants de moins de cinq ans :<br><br>- divers indicateurs démographiques, en particulier les taux de fécondité, de mortalité des enfants et de mortalité maternelle ;<br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité, tels que les comportements matrimoniaux, les comportements sexuels et l'utilisation de la contraception ;<br>- les catégories de femmes susceptibles d'avoir plus ou moins d'enfants et susceptibles d'utiliser la contraception ;<br>- les taux de connaissance et de pratique contraceptive par méthode, selon diverses caractéristiques socio-démographiques ;<br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la mortalité ;<br>- différentes composantes de la santé de la reproduction et de la santé des enfants : visites prénatales et postnatales, conditions d'accouchement, allaitement, vaccinations, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans ;<br>- l'état nutritionnel des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans au moyen des mesures anthropométriques (poids et taille) ;<br>- la prévalence de l'anémie des femmes et des enfants de moins de cinq ans au moyen d'un test sanguin ;<br>- le niveau de connaissance, les opinions et attitudes des femmes vis-à-vis des Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et du VIH/sida ;<br>- le niveau de violence domestique.<br><br>Pour les hommes de 15-59 ans : <br><br>- les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité, tels que les comportements matrimoniaux, les comportements sexuels et l'utilisation de la contraception ;<br>- les catégories d'hommes susceptibles d'avoir plus ou moins d'enfants vis-à-vis des Infections Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et du VIH/sida ;<br>- la participation des hommes dans les soins de santé.<br><br>L'ensemble des données collectées constitue une base de données qui facilitera la mise en place et le suivi de politiques et de programmes dans le domaine de la population et de la santé et, plus globalement, de politiques visant à l'amélioration des conditions de vie de la population haïtienne. Par ailleurs, les données ayant été collectées selon une méthodologie similaire à celle utilisée dans de nombreux autres pays ayant participé au programme DHS, elle font partie, de ce fait, d'une base de données utilisables et comparables au niveau international.<br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>Les principaux résultats de l'EMMUS-III peuvent être résumés comme suit et suggèrent les commentaires suivants : <br>- Caractéristiques de la population et des logements <br>La population haïtienne est surtout rurale. Elle est très jeune; en effet l'âge médian (18,9 ans) est encore très bas bien qu'on ait observé un léger vieillissement au cours de la dernière décennie. <br>- Caractéristiques socio-démographiques des enquêtés : Par rapport à l'EMMUS-II de 1994-95, on constate un léger progrès en ce qui concerne le niveau d'instruction des femmes et des hommes enquêtés, même si un certain écart existe toujours entre les sexes, surtout au niveau du secondaire et du cycle supérieur.  Les résultats ont mis en évidence une amélioration certaine du niveau d'alphabétisation. <br>- Fécondité : En prenant comme période de référence les cinq dernières années avant l'exécution de l'EMMUS-III, le niveau de fécondité reste élevé et Haïti fait partie des pays à forte fécondité. L'ISF est particulièrement élevé en milieu rural, chez les femmes non instruites et dans certains départements, témoignant du poids encore important des idées pro-natalistes et du manque d'accès de ces populations à l'information et aux services de planification familiale. <br>- Avortement : Les tabous socio-culturels et l'interdiction sur les plans tant légal que religieux de l'avortement ont certainement influencé les déclarations des enquêtées. Le taux déclaré d'avortement pour les cinq dernières années (1 %) est certainement sous-estimé. <br>- Planification familiale : Les femmes et les hommes connaissent bien les méthodes contraceptives. On relève, toutefois, que la continence périodique ne repose pas sur une base scientifique puisque pratiquement la moitié des femmes ne savent pas situer correctement la période féconde. <br>- Nuptialité et risques de grossesse : La vie en union est un phénomène quasi universel chez les Haïtiens et les Haïtiennes, et les unions multiples ne sont pas rares chez les hommes.<br>- Préférence en matière de fécondité : Les données montrent que, comparativement aux hommes, une plus forte proportion de femmes ne veulent plus avoir d'enfant. Il faut aussi noter que, comparativement à la situation en 1994-95, actuellement, relativement moins d'hommes ne veulent plus avoir d'enfant. <br>- Santé de la mère et de l'enfant : Le manque d'argent semble être perçu comme un obstacle important à l'accès aux services de santé. <br>- Nutrition et état nutritionnel des enfants et des femmes : La presque totalité des enfants nés en Haïti ont été allaités mais, par contre, presque tous reçoivent très tôt des aliments de complément.<br>- Mortalité des enfants : En Haïti, en utilisant cette méthode, les quotients de mortalité néonatale, post-néonatale, infantile et juvénile sont estimés, respectivement, à 32 ‰, 48 ‰, 80 ‰ et 42 ‰ pour les cinq dernières années.<br>- Mortalité maternelle : Le taux de mortalité maternelle a été estimé à 523 décès pour 100 000 naissances. Avec un tel taux, une femme haïtienne sur 38 risque de décéder pour cause de mortalité maternelle pendant les âges de procréation. <br>- SIDA et IST : Le niveau de connaissance du VIH/Sida par la population est très élevé. Par contre, il l'est beaucoup moins en ce qui concerne les moyens d'éviter la transmission du VIH/Sida et la population féminine est moins informée que la population masculine. <br>- Statut de la femme : Dans un contexte où la lutte pour l'égalité des sexes s'affermit en Haïti, l'EMMUS-III fournit un ensemble de données très détaillées sur le pouvoir d'action des femmes et leur statut. <br>- Hommes et rôle des sexes : Les hommes ont en général une opinion favorable en ce qui concerne le rôle des femmes dans la prise de décision dans les ménages<br>- Responsabilité des hommes en matière de santé reproductive : L'EMMUS-III a été l'occasion de poser quelques questions aux hommes pour tenter d'évaluer leur implication dans la vie parentale. <br>- Violence domestique, violence conjugale et maltraitance des enfants : Un tiers des femmes interrogées auraient subi des violences domestiques à un moment quelconque de leur vie depuis l'âge de quinze ans et même celles qui étaient enceintes, bien qu'à un moindre niveau. Les maris exercent un contrôle certain sur leur femme et ce contrôle diminue  avec l'avancement en âge de la femme et la durée de l'union. <br>- Disponibilité des services : Les résultats de l'EMMUS-III ont montré que les services socio-économiques ne sont pas répartis de façon équitable. Le milieu rural est particulièrement défavorisé. Les communautés rurales sont relativement isolées et disposent de peu de voies d'accès facile et de moyens de transport. <br>- Utilisation des services de santé : Les résultats présentés ici mettent en évidence un taux de morbidité assez élevé qui varie en fonction du niveau socio-économique ainsi que du milieu de résidence. La population et particulièrement les ménages de condition socio-économique élevée recherchent en premier lieu des soins dans les structures de niveau le plus élevé, à savoir l'hôpital.",0048318,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Guyana - Demographic and Health Survey 2009,"The survey was conducted by the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guyana. ICF Macro of Calverton, Maryland, provided technical assistance to the project through its contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Funding to cover technical assistance by ICF Macro and local costs was provided in its entirety by the USAID Mission in Georgetown, Guyana. <br><br>The primary objective of the 2009 GDHS was to collect information on characteristics of the households and their members, including exposure to malaria and tuberculosis; infant and child mortality; fertility and family planning; pregnancy and postnatal care; childhood immunization, health, and nutrition; marriage and sexual activity; and HIV/AIDS indicators. <br><br>Other objectives of the 2009 GDHS included (1) supporting the dissemination and utilization of the results in planning, managing, and improving family planning and health services in the country and (2) enhancing the survey capabilities of the institutions involved to facilitate surveys of this type in the future. <br><br>The 2009 GDHS sampled 5,632 households and completed interviews with 4,996 women age 15-49 and 3,522 men age 15-49. Three questionnaires were used for the 2009 GDHS: the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, and the Men's Questionnaire. The content of these questionnaires was based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS program of ICF Macro. <br><br>The primary objective of the 2009 GDHS was to collect information on the following topics: <br>- Characteristics of households and household members <br>- Fertility and reproductive preferences, infant and child mortality, and family planning <br>- Health-related matters, such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children's immunizations, and childhood diseases <br>- Marriage, sexual activity, and awareness and behavior regarding HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) <br>- The nutritional status of mothers and children, including anthropometry measurements and anemia testing  Other complementary objectives of the 2009 GDHS were: <br>- To support dissemination and utilization of the results in planning, managing, and improving family planning and health services in the country <br>- To enhance the survey capabilities of the institutions involved to facilitate their use of surveys of this type in the future <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>FERTILITY <br><br>Fertility Levels and Differentials <br>If fertility were to remain constant in Guyana, women would bear, on average, 2.8 children by the end of their reproductive lifespan. The total fertility rate (TFR) is close to replacement level in urban areas (2.1 children per woman), and higher in the rural areas (3.0 children per woman). The TFR in the Interior area (6.0 children) is more than twice as high as the TFR in the Coastal area (2.4 children per woman) and is three times the fertility in the Georgetown (urban) area (2.0 children). The TFRs for women in the Interior area are significantly higher for all age groups.  <br><br>Fertility Preferences <br>Fifty-six percent of currently married women reported that they don't want to have a/another child, and five percent are already sterilized. The figures for men are 51 and 1 percent, respectively. The desire to stop childbearing increases rapidly as the number of children increases. Among respondents with one child, around one in five wants no more children. Among those with three children, about eight in ten women and seven in ten men want no more children. <br><br>FAMILY PLANNING <br><br>Use of Contraception <br>Forty-three percent of women who are currently married or in union are currently using a contraceptive method, mainly a modern method (40 percent). The methods most commonly used by currently married women are the male condom (13 percent), the pill (9 percent), and the IUD (7 percent). Female sterilization and injectables are each used by 5 percent of women. The 2009 GDHS prevalence rate of 43 percent represents an increase of 8 percentage points since the 2005 GAIS (35 percent). Most of the increase was in condom use, injectables, and female sterilization. <br><br>Unmet Need for Family Planning <br>Twenty-nine percent of currently married women have an unmet need for family planning, mostly for limiting births (19 percent) compared with spacing (10 percent). Because 43 percent of married women are currently using a contraceptive method (met need), the total demand for family planning is estimated at 71 percent of married women (22 percent for spacing, 49 percent for limiting). As a result, only 60 percent of the total demand for family planning is met. <br><br>MATERNAL HEALTH <br><br>Antenatal Care <br>Among women who had a birth in the five years preceding the survey, 92 percent received antenatal care (ANC) from a skilled health provider for their most recent birth (51 percent from a nurse/midwife and 35 percent from a doctor). Older mothers (35-49 years) are less likely to receive antenatal care by a skilled health provider than younger mothers. Eighty-six percent of women with no education received ANC from a skilled health provider compared with 95 percent of women with more than secondary education. <br><br>Delivery Care <br>Overall, 92 percent of births in the five years preceding the survey were assisted by a skilled birth provider, mainly by a nurse or midwife (56 percent), followed by a doctor (31 percent). Births to mothers under age 35 and lower order births are more likely to have assistance at delivery by a skilled provider than births to older mothers and higher order births. By residence, births in Urban areas are more likely than those in Rural areas, and births in the Coastal area are more likely than births in the Interior area, to be assisted by a skilled health provider. The percentage of births assisted by a skilled provider ranges from a low of 57 percent in Region 9 to a high of 98 percent in Region 4. Births to mothers who have more education and births in the higher wealth quintiles are more likely to be assisted by a skilled provider than other births. Almost all births to mothers with more than secondary education (98 percent) are assisted by a skilled provider compared with 71 percent of births to mothers with no education. <br><br>Caesarean section <br>One in eight births (13 percent) in the five years preceding the survey was delivered by caesarean section. The prevalence of C-section delivery increases steadily with mother's age and decreases with birth order. Regions 1, 6, 7, and 9 have the lowest levels of deliveries by C-section (2-5 percent) and Region 3 has the highest level (23 percent). The percentage of births delivered by C-section increases with a mother's education and generally increases with her wealth.  <br><br>CHILD HEALTH <br><br>Infant and Child Mortality <br>Childhood mortality rates in Guyana are relatively low. For every 1,000 live births, 38 children die during the first year of life (infant mortality), and 40 children die during the first five years (under-age 5 mortality). Almost two-thirds of deaths in the first five years (25 deaths per 1,000 live births) take place during the neonatal period (the first month of life). The mortality rate after the first year of life up to age 5 (child mortality) is also very low at 3 deaths per 1,000 live births. The 2009 GDHS mortality data do not show any clear trends over time. However, mortality data have to be interpreted with caution because sampling errors associated with mortality estimates are large.  <br><br>Vaccination Coverage <br>Overall, 63 percent of Guyanese children age 18-29 months are fully immunized, and only 5 percent of the children received no vaccinations at all. Looking at coverage for specific vaccines, 94 percent of children received the BCG vaccination, 92 percent received the first dose of pentavalent vaccine, and 78 percent received the first polio dose (Polio 1). Coverage for the pentavalent and polio vaccinations declines with subsequent doses; 85 percent of children received the recommended three doses of pentavalent vaccine, and 70 percent received three doses of polio. These figures reflect dropout rates of 8 percent for the pentavalent vaccine and 11 percent for polio; the dropout rate represents the proportion of children who received the first dose of a vaccine but who did not get the third dose. Eighty-two percent of children are vaccinated against measles, and 79 percent of children have been vaccinated against yellow fever.  <br><br>Illnesses and Treatment <br><br>Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) <br>Five percent of children under age 5 had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the two weeks preceding the survey. Among children with symptoms of ARI, advice or treatment was sought from a health facility or provider for 65 percent, and antibiotics were prescribed as treatment for 18 percent (data not shown). <br><br>Fever <br>Fever was found to be moderately frequent in children under age 5 in Guyana (20 percent), ranging from 17 percent in children under 6 months to about 26 percent in children 12-17 months.. Most of the children under age 5 with fever (59 percent) were taken to a health facility or a health provider for their most recent episode of fever. Overall, about one in five children with fever (21 percent) received antibiotics, and 6 percent received antimalarial drugs. <br><br>Diarrhea <br>Overall, about 10 percent of children were reported to have diarrhea in the two weeks immediately before the survey, with just 1 percent reporting bloody diarrhea. Overall, about six in ten children under age 5 with diarrhea (59 percent) were taken to a health facility or health provider for advice or treatment. Male children (55 percent) are less likely than female children (63 percent) to be taken for treatment or advice to a health facility or provider. Additionally, children living in the Coastal area are much less likely to be taken for treatment or advice (50 percent) than children in the Interior area (79 percent). <br><br>NUTRITION OF CHILDREN <br><br>Height and Weight <br>Almost one in five children (18 percent) under age 5 is short for age or stunted, and one in twenty (5 percent) is severely stunted. As expected, stunting, which reflects chronic malnutrition, rises with age during the first year. Stunting is lower among children whose mothers have more than secondary education (16 percent). Children in Rural areas are almost twice as likely to be stunted as children in Urban areas (20 and 11 percent, respectively). The highest levels of stunting are found among children in the Interior area (35 percent). <br><br>Anemia <br>Overall, about four in ten (39 percent) children age 6-59 months have some level of anemia, in­cluding 23 percent of children who are mildly anemic, 15 percent who are moderately anemic, and less than 1 percent with severe anemia. Prevalence of any anemia is highest for children 9-11 months (74 percent) and lowest for those 36-59 months (25 to 28 percent). More than half of children in Region 1 are anemic (51 percent) compared with three in ten (30 percent) in Region 8. The percentage of children with anemia is lowest among children of mothers with secondary or higher education (38-40 percent) and among children of mothers in the highest wealth quintile (32 percent). <br><br>Malaria <br>Eighty-nine percent of households own a mosquito net, whether treated or untreated, and 66 percent of households own more than one net. Rural households are more likely to own at least one net than urban households (90 percent versus 85 percent). About nine in ten households (89 percent) in the malaria-endemic regions (Regions 1, 7, 8, and 9) have at least one mosquito net.  <br> <br>HIV/AIDS <br><br>Knowledge of HIV Prevention Methods <br>Knowledge of AIDS is almost universal in Guyana-97 percent of women and men have heard of AIDS. There are minor variations in knowledge of AIDS by age, marital status, or residence. The only exception is the level of knowledge in the Interior area, which is the lowest for both women (89 percent) and men (95 percent). <br><br>Beliefs about AIDS <br>About nine in ten Guyanese adults know that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus (87 percent of women and men) or that AIDS cannot be transmitted by supernatural means (87 percent of women and 88 percent of men). About three-quarters of women (73 percent) and two-thirds of men (65 percent) are aware that the AIDS virus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites. Furthermore, 84 percent of women and 79 percent of men know that the AIDS virus cannot be contracted by sharing food with a person who has AIDS. These findings show that the two most common local misconceptions are that the HIV virus can be transmitted (1) by mosquito bites and (2) by sharing food with someone with AIDS. <br><br>Mother-to-Child Transmission <br>About eight in ten women (79 percent) and seven in ten men (67 percent) know that HIV can be transmitted by breastfeeding. Sixty-eight percent of women and 54 percent of men are aware that the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) can be reduced by the mother taking drugs during pregnancy.<br> <br>Attitudes toward Negotiating Safer Sex <br>Almost nine in ten respondents (89 percent of women and 88 percent of men) feel that a wife is justified in refusing to have sexual intercourse with her husband if she knows that he has a sexually transmitted disease. Ninety-six percent of women and men agree that a woman is justified in either refusing sexual intercourse with her husband or in asking him to use a condom if she knows that he has an STI. <br><br>Attitudes toward Educating Children on Condom Use <br>Overall, more than eight in ten women (81 percent) and men (86 percent) age 18-49 agree that children age 12-14 should be taught to use condoms to avoid AIDS. Older respondents age 40-49 are slightly less likely than younger respondents to support education of children age 12-14 about condom use to prevent AIDS. Women and men living in the Coastal area (82 and 86 percent, respectively) are more likely than women and men living in the Interior area (73 and 82 percent, respectively) to agree about education on condom use of children age 12-14. <br><br>Higher-risk Sex <br>A larger proportion of men (10 percent) than women (1 percent) reported having had more than one sexual partner in the 12 months preceding the survey. Additionally, a higher percentage of men (30 percent) than women (17 percent) reported having had sex with a person who was neither their spouse nor their cohabiting partner (higher-risk sex) in the year before the survey. <br><br>HIV/AIDS-Related Knowledge and Sexual Behavior among Young Adults <br>About half of respondents age 15-24 (54 percent of women and 47 percent of men) have a comprehensive knowledge of AIDS (i.e., they know that people can reduce their chances of getting the AIDS virus by having sex with only one uninfected, faithful partner and by using condoms consistently; know that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus; and know that HIV cannot be transmitted by mosquito bites or by supernatural means).",0048300,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Ghana - Commercial Training 2008-2011,"The evaluation had the primary objective of measuring the impact of the FBO training program on farmers' farm productivity and crop income.  It was based on a randomized phase-in approach, taking advantage of the fact that not all FBOs that were to be part of the program could be trained at the same time, and so implicit in the program design itself was some degree of phasing. At the core of the impact evaluation was a difference-in-difference approach designed to measure the difference in agricultural output between the treatment group (a collection of FBO members who received commercial trainings in 2008 and 2009) and the control group (a collection of FBO members who received commercial trainings a year later). The Farmer-Based Organization (FBO) Survey series is a collection of data designed to evaluate the impact of these trainings on farmers in Ghana. To aid the survey and enable the implementation of the difference-in-difference approach, the FBOs were divided into two batches and each farmer was to be interviewed twice: once at baseline and again after one year. Batch 1 treatment and control farmers were surveyed in November-December 2008 and again in February-April 2010. Batch 2 treatment and control farmers were surveyed in February-April 2010 and again in November 2010-January 2011.

Ghana - Feeder Roads 2009,"The Ghana Millennium Development Authority's (MiDA) Agriculture Project within the Government of Ghana's Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation is design to improve farming in a number of areas. Under the Agricultural Project being implemented by (MiDA) some feeder roads are to be rehabilitated or reconstructed to promote development in the sector.  In the first phase, about 336 km of feeder roads in eight (8) districts in two intervention zones are to be rehabilitated to reduce transportation costs and time, and increase access to major domestic and international markets.  The feeder roads activity will also facilitate transportation linkages from rural areas to social service networks (including hospitals, clinics and schools).<br><br>The purpose of this project is to conduct an impact evaluation of the MiDA's Feeder Roads Activity.  As stated in the Terms of Reference of the request for proposals, ""the primary data for the impact evaluation will be a series of surveys similar in scope to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey, examining changes in prices over time Findings from the market surveys will contribute to the overall impact evaluation conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER).  The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 5+ is the primary instrument used in the overall evaluation, and 'Difference in Difference' is the proposed method of evaluation of data.""<br><br>Thus, this study focuses on how prices of goods sold at local markets (that are transported on improved roads) change over time.  It is also to document the changes in goods transport tariffs and passenger fares to market places served by the feeder roads.<br><br>The sample design uses a carefully tailored algorithm employed to match 154 localities that will benefit from the road improvements with an identical number of control localities that are comparatively far from the improvements. The sample size is sufficient to provide robust estimates of price effects associated with the road improvements.

Ghana - Land Titling and Financial Literacy Impact Evaluation 2010,"Secure property rights are critical for economic growth. One of the central manifestations of these rights is over land tenure. Secure land tenure can lead to increased access to credit, increased investment, and higher agricultural output. This in turn can lead to significant improvement in household welfare. However to gain access to credit, collaterals in the form of landed property may be required. Following this logic and expectations, the Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) started a Land Tilting pilot program in the Awutu-Senya District of the Central Region of Ghana in 2010. The Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) was tasked with conducting an independent impact evaluation of the outcomes after implementation. <br><br>The impact evaluation survey sought to examine the effects at different points in the chain of effects (i.e. from perceived tenure security to ultimate household welfare). Such as:<br>- The effect of land title registration on the perceived tenure security<br>- The effect of land registration on investments in land (e.g. agricultural improvements, building construction, tree planting)<br>- The effect of land title registration on access to credit<br>- The effect of land title registration on crop choice (e.g. between cash and subsistence crops) <br><br>The information gathered from the survey would generally aid decision makers in the formulation of economic and social policies to: <br>- Construct models to simulate the impact on individual groups of the various policy options and to analyze the impact of decisions that have already been implemented and of the economic situation on living conditions of households<br>- To provide benchmark data for the district assemblies <br><br>The survey can be important for planners to know how to improve the quality of people's living standards. National Development Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP), District Assemblies, Research Institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations and the general public will also greatly benefit from data of this survey.",0048249,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Ghana - Agribusiness Centers Impact Evaluation,"The Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) financed the construction of 10 Agribusiness Centers (ABCs) to provide services for the initial processing, storage, and marketing of grain crops produced by farmer-based organizations (FBOs) within their respective intervention areas. This data contains baseline information for the impact evaluation of this activity.<br><br>The treatment group for each ABC is comprised of households interviewed in the baseline survey that belong to MIDA trained FBOs within approximately 20-kilometer radius around the ABC. The comparison group for each ABC is selected from those MiDA-trained FBOs that are located outside the approximately 20-kilometer radius around the ABC. Therefore, those FBOs forming the comparison group will be loosely located between two concentric circles centered on the ABC; the inner circle will have a radius of approximately 20 kilometers, and the outer circle will have a radius of approximately 30 kilometers.<br><br>The three main research hypotheses this evaluation will try to answer (once endline data is collected), presented in form of hypotheses to be tested are: 1) access to ABCs will reduce post-harvest losses; 2) access to ABCs will imply higher market prices; and 3) access to ABCs will lead to higher crop yields. This, in turn, increases total production, total profits and, therefore, farmers' income from crop harvest.<br><br>To estimate the casual impact of this program, once endline data is collected, NORC proposed to use a double-difference estimator with matching or covariate controls as appropriate, or a combined regression analysis/matching approach to assess changes in farmers income, production, crop revenue and post-harvest losses related to access to ABCs.<br><br>We document some differences between households in the treatment and the comparison group. In particular, household heads in the treatment group are less likely to be female and have less education than in the comparison group. In agricultural practices too, we see some important differences. Households in the treatment group are more likely to grow kernel maize than households in the comparison group, which are more likely to cultivate fresh maize and rice. Treatment households cultivate a larger proportion of their land than do comparison households; conversely, comparison households irrigate a higher fraction of their land. While we see these and some other differences between the two study groups, they are similar in many other important characteristics such as number of household members, the fraction of children currently in school, and the likelihood of having experienced hunger. We also do not find major differences for agricultural or total income. This is important because it suggests that treatment and comparison groups are relatively comparable.",0048245,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Ghana - Demographic and Health Survey 2014,"The primary objective of the 2014 GDHS was to generate recent reliable information on fertility, family planning, infant and child mortality, maternal and child health, and nutrition. In addition, the survey collected specialised data on malaria treatment, prevention, and prevalence among children age 6-59 months; blood pressure among adults; anaemia among women and children; and HIV prevalence among adults. This information is essential for making informed policy decisions and for planning, monitoring, and evaluating programmes related to health in general, and reproductive health in particular, at both the national and regional levels. Analysis of data collected in the 2014 GDHS provides updated estimates of basic demographic and health indicators covered in the earlier rounds of the 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008 surveys.<br><br>The GDHS will assist policymakers and programme managers in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving the health of Ghana’s population.

"Gambia, The - Health Results-Based Financing Impact Evaluation 2014","In collaboration with the Gambia National Nutrition Agency and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, a research team from the World Bank, University of Southern California and Harvard University has developed an evaluation and roll-out design which allows rigorous assessment of the impact of the results-based financing interventions on health related outcomes. <br><br>The key objective of the impact evaluation is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the package of supply and demand side interventions developed for, and implemented at health facilities and communities as part of the Gambia Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Results Project. This project is implemented in three regions with some of the poorest performing indicators - Upper River, Central River and North Bank West Regions. Over the five-year period of implementation, the project is expected to reach approximately 183,000 children under five and 180,000 women aged 15-49 years, yielding a total of 363,000 direct beneficiaries of the project. The interventions will provide support through RBF arrangements with women, Village Development Committees (VDC) and Village Support Groups (VSG), and primary health facilities. <br><br>The primary research questions are grouped according to three broad categories: effect on nutrition and health outcomes, effect on service utilization and adoption of behaviors, and effect on intermediate outcomes along pathways of impact. The evaluation uses a mixed-methods explanatory design with an embedded process evaluation based on a conceptual framework that details out the pathways of impact for both interventions. <br><br>The overall approach for the impact evaluation is a randomized phased-in 2 x 2 design. The plan for the supply-side is that facilities in the three target regions are enrolled in the project in two phases, each lasting 18 months which should provide a sufficiently long time window to allow behavioral changes. In addition to the supply-side interventions, some communities in the target regions will be enrolled in a community-based demand-side component, for which each phase will last 12 months. <br><br>To measure the community-level impact of the project, three main surveys are to be conducted. A baseline survey was administered at the beginning of the project in October 2014 - February 2015. A midline survey is planned to be conducted approximately 18 months after the project launch, and an endline survey - after approximately 36 months of the project start. <br><br>The quantitative and qualitative data from the baseline survey is documented here.

El Salvador - Production and Business Services (Impact) 2009-2011,"The Productive Development Project (PDP) was one of three large-scale projects financed under the 2006 compact between the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of El Salvador. The main objective of the PDP was to assist in the development of profitable and sustainable business ventures for poor individuals in El Salvador's Northern Zone. Between 2008 and 2012, the PDP used nearly $72 million in allocated funds to serve over 13,500 participants and create more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The PDP comprised three activities: Production and Business Services (PBS), Investment Support, and Financial Services. The PBS Activity -- the subject of this impact evaluation and the largest of the three activities -- provided technical and material assistance to farmers and small-scale producers to support the Northern Zone's dairy, fruit, horticulture, handicrafts, tourism, forestry, and coffee sectors.<br><br>The design for the impact evaluation of the PBS Activity is a randomized rollout design, in which some producers were offered PBS assistance several months before other producers were offered similar assistance. The goal of this design is to attain the highest level of rigor possible without significantly altering existing implementation plans. The evaluation is limited to three value chains: (1) handicrafts, (2) dairy, and (3) horticulture. Among all value chains in the PBS, these three chains were most amenable to random assignment, and were expected to yield impacts in the one-year interim timeline specified for the evaluation. <br><br>Treatment groups were offered PBS assistance in the first implementation phase (beginning in late 2009 for handicrafts and mid-2010 in the case of the dairy and horticulture chains) and control groups in the dairy and horticulture chains were offered PBS assistance roughly one year after the treatment group. As over 15,000 individuals had participated in the PBS Activity by August 2012, this evaluation sample of 1,736 individuals (518, 593, and 625 in the dairy, horticulture, and handicrafts chains, respectively) includes only 11 percent of the individuals served under the activity.",0048075,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Djibouti - Social Safety Net Interlinking Nutrition and Workfare Impact Evaluation 2014,"Unemployment is strikingly high in Djibouti: only 30% of the adult population is classified as employed, according to the most recent household survey data (EDAM 2012). Since the time of the 2008 food and fuel crisis and in the lack of social safety nets that could be scaled up to respond to the crisis, the Government aimed at promoting temporary access to employment through workfare. Moreover, in spite of progress made towards meeting some health and education-related MDGs, Djibouti's health indicators remain among the poorest in the world. The national prevalence of moderate and severe stunting in the most recent MICS survey is of 33% among children aged 0-5 years old, a prevalence rate comparable to Sub-Saharan countries of a much lower income per capita. <br><br>In order to address both issues, the Government of Djibouti is piloting an innovative integrated public works and nutrition intervention. The intervention (i) actively involves the main caregiver in a number of ways (nutrition, workfare) to strengthen her role in the household and (ii) makes access to income (workfare) conditional on the caregiver attending regular nutrition promotion activities. The program targets households with pregnant women and children 0-2 years of age in poor areas (urban and rural) in Djibouti. <br><br>The first objective of this evaluation is to test the value added of combining a public works program targeted to women over and above the provision of information and promotion of behavioral change in child care practices. That is, the evaluation will specifically measure the impact of making an integrated nutrition and workfare intervention available compared to a nutrition program by itself. As access to the public works is given only to households where the women has registered to the community nutrition program, the program's goal is to leverage the additional cash income (net of the opportunity cost of participation) to enhance the adoption of improved nutrition practices. The planned evaluation will provide a test for the interaction effect between income and the information and promotion of behavioral change. <br><br>The second objective is to test whether these effects are only short term, or whether they extend beyond the fifty days of participation in the public works program. The safety net, by design, provides only short term income support during the first 1,000 days. This evaluation is interested in measuring the extent that the impact extends beyond the contemporaneous duration of the safety net program, after the women have stopped participating. Participants and the control group will be interviewed at endline five months after having exited the workfare program. The medium term effects might in part persist through short term savings, but also through labor supply activation and improved psychological wellbeing of the participants.",0047975,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

"Congo, Dem. Rep. - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 2007","L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé en République Démocratique du Congo (EDS-RDC) de 2007 est la première enquête du genre réalisée dans le pays. De portée nationale, l'EDS-RDC fournit des informations sur les ménages, la fécondité, la mortalité, la planification familiale, la santé de la reproduction, etc. En outre, des données ont été collectées sur la prévalence du VIH et sur les attitudes et comportements des populations par rapport au sida. Elle a été exécutée par une structure spécialement mise en place pour la réalisation de l'enquête sous la tutelle du Ministère du Plan. Cette enquête a bénéficié de l'assistance technique de Macro International, institution de coopération américaine en charge du programme international des Enquêtes Démographiques et de Santé (EDS) à travers le monde. Son financement provient de plusieurs partenaires : les agences des Nations Unies notamment l'UNICEF et l'UNFPA, la Banque Mondiale à travers PNMLS et le PARSS, le DFID et l'USAID. <br><br>La collecte des données pour l'enquête principale s'est déroulée en deux temps. Dans un premier temps, elle a eu lieu dans la capitale, Kinshasa, du 31 janvier au 7 mars 2007, avec comme agents de terrain les candidats superviseurs de pool. Dans un deuxième temps, elle s'est déroulée, pendant un mois, dans les pools autres que Kinshasa 1 et s'est étalée sur une période allant de mai à août 2007. <br><br>Au total, 9002 ménages ont été sélectionnés et, parmi eux, 8945 ont été identifiés. Parmi les ménages identifiés, 8886 ont été enquêtés avec succès, soit un taux de réponse de 99 %. À l'intérieur des 8886 ménages enquêtés, 10338 femmes de 15-49 ans ont été identifiées comme étant éligibles pour l'enquête individuelle et, pour 9995 d'entre elles, l'enquête a pu être menée à bien. Le taux de réponse s'établit à 97 %. L'enquête auprès des hommes, réalisée dans un ménage sur deux, a permis d'identifier 4985 hommes de 15-59 ans et, parmi eux, 4757 ont été enquêtés avec succès, soit un taux de réponse de 95 %. <br>Les résultats de l'enquête indiquent que 43 % de la population vivent en milieu urbain contre 57 % en milieu rural et que le rapport de masculinité de la population s'établit à 97 hommes pour 100 femmes. Seulement 21 % des ménages sont dirigés par une femme. La taille moyenne des ménages est de 5,4 personnes pour l'ensemble du pays, 5,9 personnes en milieu urbain contre 5,2 personnes en milieu rural. La population congolaise est caractérisée par sa jeunesse : 48 % ont moins de 15 ans et 4 % ont 60 ans et plus. <br><br>La proportion de femmes de 15-49 ans sans instruction est quatre fois plus élevée que celle des hommes (21 % contre 5 %) et les hommes sont proportionnellement deux fois plus nombreux que les femmes à avoir achevé les niveaux secondaires ou supérieurs (65 % contre 41 %). La proportion des personnes de 15-49 ans qui ne savent ni lire ni écrire (analphabètes) atteint 41 % parmi les femmes et 14 % parmi les hommes de 15-49 ans. Par ailleurs, au moment de l'enquête, 48 % de la population congolaise disposaient d'eau potable ; 18 % de la population avaient accès à l'électricité et 18 % de la population utilisaient des latrines hygiéniques. <br><br>OBJECTIFS DE L'EDS-RDC<br><br>Les objectifs assignés à la première édition de l'Enquête Démographique et de Santé en République Démocratique du Congo (EDS-RDC) peuvent se résumer de la manière suivante :  <br>- Fournir aux responsables et aux programmes de population en République Démocratique du Congo des données de base actualisées sur la fécondité, la mortalité, la planification familiale et la santé de la reproduction ; <br>- Permettre l'élaboration des indicateurs de suivi définis lors des grands sommets sur la population et la santé et par le Document de la Stratégie de Croissance et de Réduction de la Pauvreté ; <br>- Analyser les facteurs qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité et de la mortalité infanto-juvénile ; <br>- Actualiser les données sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant : vaccination ; prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée, de la fièvre et de la toux ; paludisme ; visites prénatales ; assistance à l'accouchement ; et allaitement maternel ; <br>- Mesurer l'état nutritionnel des enfants de moins de cinq ans et des femmes par le biais des mesures anthropométriques ; <br>- Estimer la prévalence de l'anémie au sein de la population ; <br>- Évaluer le niveau de connaissance du VIH/sida ; <br>- Estimer la prévalence du VIH dans la population générale d'âge adulte. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>- Les données de l'EDS-RDC ont mis en évidence le niveau élevé de la fécondité au Congo. En effet, au niveau national, le nombre moyen d'enfants par femme en fin de vie féconde est estimé à 6,3.<br><br>- Les résultats de l'EDS-RDC montrent que les méthodes contraceptives sont relativement bien connues en RDC : un peu plus de huit femmes sur dix (82 %) contre environ neuf hommes sur dix (89%) ont déclaré connaître au moins une méthode.  <br><br>- Concernant les soins prénatals pour les naissances survenues au cours des cinq dernières années, on note que plus de huit femmes sur dix (85 %) se sont rendues en consultation prénatale dispensée par du personnel formé. Près d'une femme sur deux (47%) a effectué au moins les quatre visites recommandées par l'OMS pour les femmes enceintes. <br><br>- Les résultats indiquent que 31% des enfants de 12-23 mois avaient été complètement vaccinés et que 18% n'avaient reçu aucun des vaccins du PEV. Au total, 28 % des enfants de 12-23 mois ont été complètement vaccinés selon le calendrier recommandé (avant l'âge de 12 mois). <br><br>- Moins d'un tiers des ménages congolais (28%) possèdent au moins une moustiquaire, qu'elle ait été traitée ou non. <br><br>- Par rapport à l'indice taille-pour-âge, les résultats montrent que 46 % des enfants de moins de cinq ans accusent un retard de croissance et, souffrent donc de malnutrition chronique. Près d'un enfant sur quatre (24%) en souffre sous la forme sévère. À l'exception de Kinshasa, toutes les provinces sont gravement affectées par cette forme de malnutrition. <br><br>- La mortalité des enfants est élevée en RDC. Les résultats montrent que durant la période récente (2002-2007), sur 1 000 naissances vivantes, 92 décèdent avant d'atteindre le premier anniversaire (42 entre 0 et 1 mois exact et 50 entre 1 et 12 mois exact). <br><br>- La mortalité maternelle est élevée en RDC. Pour la période 0-4 ans avant l'enquête, le taux de mortalité maternelle est estimé à 549 décès maternels pour 100 000 naissances vivantes. Le risque de mortalité maternelle sur la durée de vie, calculé à partir du taux de mortalité maternelle est de l'ordre de 0,034, ce qui signifie en d'autres termes, qu'en RDC une femme court un risque d'environ 1 sur 29 de décéder pour une cause maternelle durant les âges de procréation.  <br><br>- La quasi-totalité des enquêtés ont entendu parler du VIH/sida (92% des femmes et 97% des hommes) ; cependant, seulement 15% des femmes et 22% des hommes de 15-49 ans peuvent être considérés comme ayant une connaissance « complète » du sida. La possibilité de transmission du VIH de la mère à l'enfant par l'allaitement est connue par 55% des femmes et 53% des hommes ; mais seulement 14% des femmes et 15% des hommes savent que le risque de transmission du VIH de la mère à l'enfant peut être réduit par la prise de médicaments spéciaux pendant la grossesse. <br><br>- Dans l'ensemble, 88% des enquêtés ont fourni les gouttes de sang qui ont été analysées pour le test du VIH. Le taux de couverture est plus élevé en milieu rural (91%) qu'en milieu urbain (86%). En général, le taux est plus élevé chez les femmes (90%) que chez les hommes (86%). Au total, 6 % des femmes et 7% des hommes ont refusé le test. <br><br>- Selon l'EDS-RDC, 9 % des enfants de moins de 18 ans sont des orphelins d'au moins un parent et 18 % sont considérés comme étant devenus vulnérables du fait d'une maladie ou d'un décès survenu parmi les membres adultes du ménage. Globalement, 25% de ces enfants sont considérés des orphelins ou enfants rendus vulnérables (OEV). <br><br>- L'enquête révèle que plus des trois quarts des femmes (76%) pensent que le mari a le droit de battre sa femme pour au moins l'une des certaines raisons. Par ailleurs, 22% des femmes pensent qu'une femme a le droit de refuser d'avoir des rapports sexuels avec son partenaire pour une raison ou un autre. <br><br>- Près de deux femmes sur trois (64%) ont déclaré avoir subi des violences physiques à un moment quelconque de leur vie depuis l'âge de 15 ans et près de la moitié (49%) au cours des douze mois ayant précédé l'enquête.",0047872,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Comoros - Enquête à Indicateurs Multiples 2000,"La République Fédérale Islamique des Comores, représentée par le Chef de l’Etat, a signé la Déclaration et le Plan d’Action pour les Enfants adoptés par le Sommet Mondial pour les Enfants (SME), tenu à New York en septembre 1990. Elle s’est ainsi engagée à réaliser les objectifs arrêtés alors, mais également à procéder à un suivi régulier pour en évaluer les progrès. En raison d’un contexte politique plutôt difficile, seule cette évaluation, au terme de la décennie, a été réalisée, sur la base de l’Enquête à Indicateur Multiple (MICS, selon les initiales en anglais). Ce Rapport présente les résultats de cette évaluation qui mesure les progrès accomplis, à travers les modules retenus par le SME comme essentiels pour la survie et le développement de l’enfant. A titre d’exemple, on citera ici comme particulièrement significatives, la vaccination, la prise en charge d’affections médicalement bénignes, mais mortelles dans certains pays dont les Comores, la préservation de certaines carences nutritionnelles préjudiciables au développement de l’enfant... D’autres aspects tout aussi importants sont également pris en compte comme la lutte contre toutes les formes d’exploitation des enfants, et notamment par le travail, la jouissance d’un habitat sain, l’accès à une eau salubre, et surtout le droit à une éducation de base. Il ne s’agit là que de quelques points parmi les plus importants visés par le Plan d’Action. Comme cette enquête vient d’être menée pour la première fois, elle ne peut prétendre à la perfection, malgré toute l’application et tous les soins dont elle a été l’objet. De ce fait, certaines de ses données doivent être traitées avec quelque précaution. C’est ce qui a été fait ici, en toute rigueur méthodologique, avec le souci constant de la fiabilité et de la cohérence. C’est ainsi que, lorsque cela s’est avéré nécessaire, d’autres sources que le MICS et émanant des secteurs d’activité concernés ont été exploités, s’ils étaient récents et s’ils répondaient aux critères de pertinence et de fiabilité. Dans cet ordre d’idée et pour les mêmes raisons, des aménagements ont été réalisés en amont de l’enquête pour adapter, dans certains cas, le questionnaire aux réalités locales.",0047849,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Colombia - Shortening Supply Chains: Experimental Evidence from Fruit and Vegetable Vendors in Bogota 2016-2018,"Fruit and vegetable vendors in Bogota travel most days to a central market to purchase produce, incurring substantial costs. A social enterprise attempted to shorten the supply chain between farmers and vendors by aggregating orders from many small stores and delivering orders directly. We randomized the introduction of this service at the market-block level. Initial interest was high, and the service reduced travel time and costs, and increased work-life balance. Purchase costs fell 6 to 8 percent, there was incomplete pass-through into lower prices for consumers, and markups rose. However, stores reduced sales of products not offered by this new service, and their total sales and profits appear to have fallen in the short-run, with service usage falling over time. The results offer a window into the nature of competition among small retailers, and point to the challenges in achieving economies of scale when disrupting centralized markets for multi-product firms.",0047827,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Chad - Enquête Démographique et de Santé 1996-1997,"L'enquête Démographique et de Santé au Tchad (EDST) a été exécutée par le Bureau Central du Recensement (BCR), Direction de la Statistique, des Études Économiques et Démographiques (DSEED) avec l'assistance technique de Macro International Inc. Il s'agit de la première enquête par sondage, réalisée au niveau national, dont les objectifs étaient de fournir des informations détaillées sur la fécondité, la planification familiale, la santé de la mère et de l'enfant, l'état nutritionnel des enfants de moins de cinq ans, la mortalité infanto-juvénile, la mortalité maternelle et sur la disponibilité des services communautaires. Ces informations donnent un éclairage de la situation démographique et sanitaire du Tchad. <br><br>Au cours de I'EDST, réalisée sur le terrain de décembre 1996 à juillet 1997, 6840 ménages, 7454 femmes en âge de procréer ( 15-49 ans) et 2320 hommes de 15-59 ans ont été enquêtés avec succès, avec des taux de couverture respectif de 98,7 %, 96,7 % et 94 %. <br><br>L'Enquête Démographique et de Santé du Tchad (EDST) vise à atteindre un certain nombre d'objectifs dont les principaux sont : <br>- recueillir des données à l'échelle nationale et par milieu de résidence permettant de calculer divers indicateurs démographiques, en particulier les taux de fécondité et de mortalité infantile et juvénile; <br>- mesurer le niveau de mortalité maternelle au niveau national; <br>- analyser les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la fécondité, tels que les structures du mariage et l'utilisation de la contraception; <br>- identifier les catégories de femmes susceptibles d'avoir plus ou moins d'enfants et susceptibles d'utiliser la contraception; <br>- mesurer les taux de connaissance et de pratique contraceptive par méthode, selon diverses caractéristiques socio-démographiques des femmes et des hommes; <br>- analyser les facteurs directs et indirects qui déterminent les niveaux et tendances de la mortalité; <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur les causes de décès des enfants de moins de cinq ans; <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur la santé maternelle et infantile: visite prénatale, assistance à l'accouchement, allaitement, vaccinations, supplémentation en Vitamine A, prévalence et traitement de la diarrhée et d'autres maladies chez les enfants de moins de cinq ans; <br>- évaluer le niveau d'utilisation de sel iodé; <br>- déterminer l'état nutritionnel des mères et des enfants de moins de cinq ans au moyen des mesures anthropométriques (poids et taille); <br>- recueillir des données détaillées sur la connaissance, les opinions et attitudes des femmes et des hommes vis-à-vis des Maladies Sexuellement Transmissibles (MST) et du Sida. <br><br>De plus, I'EDST fournit des informations sur la disponibilité et l'accessibilité des services socio- économiques et sanitaires au niveau des communautés. <br><br>L'ensemble des données collectées constitue une base de données qui facilitera le suivi et l'évaluation ì long terme des programmes de Santé Maternelle et Infantile et du Bien-]~tre Familial au Tchad (SMI/BEF). <br>Enfin, la réalisation de cette enquête contribue au renforcement du cadre institutionnel et au renforcement des compétences des cadres nationaux nécessaires pour entreprendre la collecte et l'analyse de données démographiques, soeio-économiques et sanitaires. <br><br>PRINCIPAUX RESULTATS<br><br>La structure de la population par âge révèle une extrême jeunesse de la population du Tchad dont la moitié est âgée de moins de 15 ans. Par ailleurs, la répartition de cette population par milieu de résidence indique que la population tchadienne est essentiellement rurale : 76 % des personnes enquêtées vivent en milieu rural contre 24 % en milieu urbain. <br><br>La fécondité des femmes tchadiennes est l'une des plus élevée en Afrique : en fin de vie féconde, elles ont, en moyenne, 6,6 enfants. L'une des caractéristiques de cette fécondité est sa précocité : une femme sur deux donne naissance à son premier enfant ì 18,3 ans. Les résultats de l'enquête ont mis en évidence des variations du niveau de fécondité selon le milieu de résidence. Les femmes du milieu rural (6,8 enfants par femme) donnent naissance, en moyenne, à 1 enfant de plus que celles de N'Djaména (5,8) et à 0,5 enfant de plus que celles des Autres Villes (6,3). <br><br>Parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans, 78 % étaient mariées au moment de l'enquête et, à partir de 30 ans, moins de 1% des femmes étaient toujours célibataires : ainsi, le mariage qui demeure le cadre presque exclusif de la procréation, est quasi universel au Tchad. En outre, près de deux femmes mariées sur cinq (39 %) vivent en union polygame. L'âge d'entrée en union est très précoce : à 18 ans, près des trois quarts des femmes (73 %) sont déjà mariées et l'âge médian au premier mariage est de 15,8 ans. Les premiers rapports sexuels se produisent également très tôt (âge médian de 15, 5 ans). En outre, aucune tendance ne semble se dessiner dans le sens d'une modification de r âge d'entrée en union, même si les jeunes générations semblent se marier moins précocement que les générations les plus âgées (16,4 ans parmi les générations de 20-24 ans contre 15,6 ans parmi celles de plus de 40 ans). On constate d'autre part que le calendrier de la primo-nuptialité n'est guère influencé par le milieu de résidence (16,0 en urbain contre 15,8 ans en rural). Le niveau d'instruction, par contre, influe sur l'âge au premier mariage, les femmes sans instruction (15,7 ans) se mariant plus précocement que celles ayant un niveau d'instruction primaire (16,4 ans) et surtout que celles ayant un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus (18,0). Cette précocité des premiers rapports sexuels et du mariage expliquent la précocité de la fécondité. <br><br>Les hommes contractent leur première union à un âge plus tardif que celui des femmes, leur âge médian au mariage étant estimé à 22,6 ans. Cet âge médian au premier mariage est plus élevé à N'Djaména et dans les Autres Villes qu'en milieu rural. De même que chez les femmes, un niveau d'instruction élevé retarde l'entrée en union des hommes. De plus, la polygamie est relativement répandue puisqu'elle concerne un quart des hommes mariés. <br><br>Le niveau de connaissance contraceptive est extrêmement faible au Tchad : seulement 45 % des femmes et 72 % des hommes ont déclaré connaître une méthode de contraception. Les méthodes modernes sont mieux connues que les méthodes traditionnelles. En outre, très peu de femmes tchadiennes utilisent une méthode contraceptive (4 %). Les méthodes modernes sont utilisées par 1,2 % des femmes, essentiellement la pilule (0,6 % ) et le condom (0,3 %); quant aux méthodes traditionnelles ou populaires, 2,6 % des femmes y ont recours; la continence périodique est la méthode la plus utilisée (2,0). Les niveaux d'utilisation de la contraception varient fortement selon le milieu de résidence et le niveau d'instruction. A. N'Djaména, 11,8 % des femmes mariées utilisent la contraception et environ la moitié d'entre elles utilisent une méthode moderne (6,7 %), alors que la prévalence contraceptive n'est que de 2,7 % en milieu rural où les femmes utilisent surtout les méthodes traditionnelles/populaires (2,4 %). De même, 24 % des femmes ayant un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus utilisent une méthode de contraception, et surtout une méthode moderne (13 %), alors que la prévalence n'atteint pas 3 % parmi les femmes sans instruction. De même, les hommes vivant à N'Djaména (27,5 %) et ceux qui ont un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus (12,6 %) sont ceux qui ont la prévalence contraceptive la plus élevée. <br><br>Plus des trois quarts des femmes et des hommes n'ont pas l'intention d'utiliser la contraception dans l'avenir (79 %). Le désir d'enfants est la raison principale avancée par les hommes et les femmes (41% des femmes et 53 % des hommes) pour ne pas utiliser la contraception dans l'avenir. Les hommes et les femmes tchadiens restent attachés à une descendance nombreuse puisque pour les femmes, le nombre idéal d'enfants est de 8,3; il est de 13,4 enfants pour les hommes. <br><br>L'EDST fournit également un ensemble d'informations très importantes sur la santé et l'état nutritionnel de la mère et de l'enfant. Concernant les soins prénatals et les conditions d'accouchement, on constate que pour 32 % seulement des naissances des cinq dernières années, la mère a reçu des soins prénatals dispensées par du personnel formé; dans 31% des cas seulement, elle a reçu, au moins, une injection antitétanique pendant la grossesse; l'accouchement n'a eu lieu dans une formation sanitaire que pour 11% des naissances; un professionnel de la santé a assisté 24 % des accouchements et près d'une naissance sur trois s'est déroulée avec l'aide d'une accoucheuse traditionnelle non formée; en outre, 7 % des femmes ont accouché seule, sans aucune aide. D'autre part, on constate d'énormes différences du point de vue du niveau d'instruction de la mère et surtout du point de vue du milieu de résidence : pour 72 % des naissances, les mères de N'Djaména ont bénéficié de soins prénatals contre 64 % dans les Autres Villes et seulement 23 % en milieu rural. De même, à N'Djaména, 57 % des accouchements ont été assistés par des professionnels de la santé contre 45 % dans les Autres Villes et seulement 16 % en milieu rural. <br><br>La vaccination contre les maladies-cible du Programme Élargi de Vaccination (PEV), à savoir la tuberculose, la diphtérie, le tétanos, la coqueluche, la polio, la rougeole et la fièvre jaune, est un facteur clé d'amélioration du taux de survie des enfants. D'après I'EDST, parmi les enfants de 12 à 23 mois qui, selon les recommandations de l'OMS, devraient être tous vaccinés contre les maladies-cible du PEV, 39 % seulement sont vaccinés contre la tuberculose, 20 % ont reçu les trois doses de DTCoq, 18 % les trois doses de polio, 23 % seulement sont vaccinés contre la rougeole et 20 % contre la fièvre janne. Seulement 1 enfant tchadien sur 10 a reçu toutes les vaccinations du PEV et, à l'opposé, plus de deux enfants sur cinq (44 %) n'ont reçu aucune de ces vaccinations. Ces taux de couverture vaccinale déjà très faibles au niveau national, masquent d'importantes disparités selon le milieu de tésidence et le niveau d'instruction des mères: en milieu rural, plus d'un enfant sur deux (51%) n'a reçu aucune vaccination; cette proportion est de 18 % dans les Autres Villes et de 17 % à N'Djaména. De même, 38 % des enfants dont la mère a un niveau d'instruction secondaire ou plus sont complètement vaccin~s, contre 17 % de ceux dont la mère a un niveau primaire et 8 % seulement de ceux dont la mère est sans instruction. <br><br>D'après les déclarations des mères, pendant les deux semaines ayant précédé l'enquête, 13 % des enfants de moins de 5 ans ont souffert de toux et de respiration courte et rapide, symptômes d'infections respiratoires aiguës; du point de vue de la résidence, les enfants vivant à N'Djaména ( 16 %) sont sensiblement plus touchés qu ceux du milieu rural (13 %) et que ceux des Autres Villes (10 %); 32 % des enfants ont souffert de fièvre qui peut, dans de nombreux cas, être un symptôme du paludisme; comme pour la toux, ce sont les enfants de N'Djaména qui sont les plus touchés; enfin, 22 % des enfants ont eu un ou plusieurs épisodes diarrh6iques et on ne constate pas de différence de prévalence selon les milieux d'habitat. Quelle que soit la maladie, seulement un enfant sur cinq (19 %) a été mené en consultation lorsqu'il était malade. Parmi les enfants ayant eu la diarrhée, un sur trois (33 %) n'a bénéficié d'aucune forme de Thérapie de Réhydratation par voie Orale ('FRO), alors que 66 % des femmes ont déclaré connaître les sachets de SRO. <br><br>La quasi-totalité des enfants tchadiens nés au cours des cinq années ayant précédé l'enquête (98 %) ont été allaités, mais une très faible proportion d'entre eux (24 %) ont été mis au sein dès la naissance. Alors que jusqu'à l'âge de 6 mois, tous les enfants ne devraient recevoir rien d'autre que le sein, dès 0-1 mois, 56 % des nouveau-nés reçoivent de l'eau en plus du lait et 39 % des compléments au lait maternel, ce qui affecte leur état nutritionnel et augmente leur risque de contracter des maladies infectieuses. En moyenne, et quelles que soient les caractéristiques de la m&e, les enfants sont allaités pendant environ 21,4 mois. <br><br>Deux enfants sur cinq (40 %) sont atteints d'un retard de croissance qui révèle un état de malnutrition chronique, et près de la moitié de ces enfants sont affectés par la forme sévère de cette malnutrition. Un enfant sur sept (14 %) est émacié, c'est-à-dire atteint de malnutrition aiguë. Cette situation nutritionnelle des enfants, déjà très préoccupante au niveau national, est encore plus alarmante au niveau de certaines sous- populations : ainsi, le retard de croissance atteint 42 % des enfants du milieu rural et en ce qui concerne la forme sévère de la malnutrition chronique, il y a environ deux fois plus d'enfants atteints en milieu rural qu'à N'Djaména; la prévalence de l'émaciation est beaucoup plus élevée dans les Autres Villes et en milieu rural qu'à N'Djaména (9 % contre 14 %). <br>Conséquence d'une situation sanitaire déficiente et d'un mauvais état nutritionnel, la mortalité des enfants tchadiens est l'une des plus élevée au monde. Sur mille enfants qui naissent, 103 décèdent avant le premier anniversaire et, 194 décèdent avant l'âge de 5 ans. Globalement, 1 enfant sur 5 décède entre la naissance et le cinquième anniversaire. Cette très forte mortalité qui semble n'avoir que peu évolué durant les quinze dernières années, ne présente que peu de différence entre les différents milieux de résidence, la mortalité infantile variant de 99 %o à N'Djaména et dans les Autres Villes à 113 %o en milieu rural; quant à la mortalité juvénile, elle ne présente pratiquement aucune variation (101%o en milieu urbain contre 103 %, en milieu rural). En outre, les résultats ont mis en évidence de fortes variations selon les caractéristiques des mères. La probabilité de mourir avant cinq ans des enfants survivants à 1 an est de 104 %~ quand leur mère n'a aucune instruction contre 93 %o lorsqu'il a fréquenté l'école. <br><br>Autre conséquence de cette situation sanitaire déficiente, les femmes courent un risque élevé de décéder par cause maternelle. Pour la période 1991-1997, parmi l'ensemble des décès de femmes en âge de procréation, 2 décès sur 5 (41%) étaient imputables à des causes maternelles. Pour la même période, on estime que le taux de mortalité maternelle se situait à environ 827 décès maternels pour 100 000 naissances : exprimé différemment, cela signifie qu'une femme court un risque de 1 sur 18 de décéder par cause maternelle durant sa vie féconde. <br><br>La majorité des hommes (88 %) ont entendu parler du sida contre 60 % des femmes. Or, un tiers des hommes (30 %) et près d'une femme sur deux (44 %) ne connaissent pas de moyens pour éviter de contracter cette maladie. De plus, seulement 13 % des hommes et 3 % des femmes ont déclaré utiliser le condom pour éviter de contracter le sida ou une autre MST au cours des rapports sexuels qu'ils ont eus dans les 2 mois précédant l'enquête. <br><br>Les résultats de l'enquête sur la disponibilité des services communautaires ont mis en évidence non seulement le manque de disponibilité de certaines infrastructures socio-économiques, mais aussi les difficultés d'accès à certains établissements du fait de l'éloignement et des temps de trajet importants. Ainsi, en milieu rural, la distance médiane qu'il faut parcourir pour atteindre une pharmacie est de 15,7 kilomètres; pour atteindre un hôpital public, la moitié des femmes du milieu rural doivent parcourir 70,5 kilomètres. De même, seulement un quart des Tchadiennes vivent à proximité d'un établissement de santé offrant des services de PF alors que près de la moitié (47 %) en sont très éloignées. En ce qui concerne les établissements de santé offrant des services de santé maternelle et infantile, on constate que 24 % des femmes mettent moins d'une demi-heure pour atteindre ce type d'établissement le plus proche mais que plus de la moitié des femmes (51%) ont une durée de déplacement de deux heures ou plus pour atteindre ce type de service; en milieu rural, le temps médian de trajet est de trois heures. Par ailleurs, en ce qui concerne les principaux problèmes pour se soigner, le manque d'établissement sanitaire et le manque d'eau sont les deux problèmes qui ont été cités le plus fréquemment, cela quel que soit le milieu de résidence.",0047791,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Chad - COVID-19 High Frequency Phone Survey 2020,"In Chad, COVID-19 is expected to affect households in many ways. First, governments might reduce social transfers to households due to the decline in revenue arising from the potential COVID-19 economic recession. Second households deriving income from vulnerable sectors such as tourism and related activities will likely face risk of unemployment or loss of income. Third an increase in prices of imported goods can also negatively impact household welfare, as a direct consequence of the increase of these imported items or as indirect increase of prices of local good manufactured using imported inputs. In this context, there is a need to produce high frequency data to help policy makers in monitoring the channels by which the pandemic affects households and assessing its distributional impact. To do so, the sample of the longitudinal survey will be a sub-sample of the 2018/19 Enquête sur la Consommation des Ménages et le Secteur Informel au Tchad (Ecosit 4) in Chad.<br><br>This has the advantage of conducting cost effectively welfare analysis without collecting new consumption data. The 30 minutes questionnaires covered many modules, including knowledge, behavior, access to services, food security, employment, safety nets, shocks, coping, etc. Data collection is planned for four months (four rounds) and the questionnaire is designed with core modules and rotating modules.<br><br>The main objectives of the survey are to:<br>• Identify type of households directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic;<br>• Identify the main channels by which the pandemic affects households;<br>• Provide relevant data on income and socioeconomic indicators to assess the welfare impact of the pandemic.",0047776,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Burundi - Demographic and Health Survey 1987,"Cette étude nationale permet d'estimer certains paramètres démographiques d'une part et de fournir des informations sur les attitudes et pratiques de la planification familiale chez les femmes burundaises et leurs maris, et sur la santé de la mère et de l'enfant. Les objectifs de l'enquête sont les suivants:<br><br>- Etudier les niveaux et les déterminants de la fécondité;<br>- Etudier la connaissance et l'utilisation des méthodes contraceptives et les attitudes envers la planification familiale chez les femmes et leurs maris;<br>- Etudier les niveaux et les causes de la mortalité infantile dont la connaissance est vitale pour une meilleure action sanitaire dans ce domaine;<br>- Etudier les différents aspects liés à la santé des enfants dont l'étude de la prévalence et du traitement de la diarrhée ainsi que l'état nutritionnel des enfants agés de moins de trois ans par le biais des mesures anthropométriques;<br>- Fournir aux responsables et administrateurs des programmes de population et de santé au Burundi des données de base actualisées et de qualité sur la fécondité, la mortalité, la planification familiale et la santé.<br><br>Les conclusions principales sont présentées ci-après:<br><br>- La fécondité au Burundi est très élevée et, au niveau national, elle ne semble pas être en baisse: la somme des naissances r6duites est de 6,8 enfants chez les femmes de 15-44 ans, et la descendance atteinte par les femmes 40-49 ans est de 6,9 enfants. Une baisse de la fécondité s'est amorcée seulement chez deux groupes de femmes qui constituent de très faibles proportions des femmes aux âges féconds: les femmes urbaines et les femmes qui ont atteint le niveau d'éducation secondaire.<br><br>- Le mariage quasi-universel contribue au haut niveau de la fécondité: 92 pour cent des femmes s'étaient mariées avant l'âge de 25 ans, et 83 pour cent des femmes de 25-49 ans étaient en union au moment de l'enquête. Pourtant, l'âge au premier mariage (médiane 19,5 ans) n'est pas précoce par rapport à d'autres pays en Afrique au sud du Sahara. L'âge au premier mariage semble, aussi, être en hausse chez les jeunes générations (femmes de 15-24 ans).<br><br>- La durée très longue de l'allaitement (médiane de 24 mois) et la longue durée d'aménorrhée qui en résulte (médiane de 18 mois), constituent le seul élément qui tend à contenir la fécondité maritale. La période d'abstinence post-partum est très courte (médiane de 1 mois) et l'utilisation de la contraception est pratiquement inexistante. (taux de prévalence pour les méthodes modernes de 1 pour cent).<br><br>- Néanmoins, il y a des indications que la population burundaise pourrait être bien disposée à la planification familiale, aussi bien pour la limitation que pour l'espacement des naissances. La connaissance des méthodes contraceptives est assez répandue: 70 pour cent de l'ensemble des femmes et 92 pour cent des maris connaissent au moins une méthode. <br><br>- En ce qui concerne la mortalité des enfants, le quotient 5q0 durant la période de 1982-86 était de 152 pour mille. La mortalité infantile (75 pour mille) est relativement faible par rapport à la mortalité de 1 à 4 ans (83 pour mille). La mortalité des enfants semble être en baisse: le quotient 5q0 6tait de plus de 200 pour mille pour les périodes plus éloignées de l'enquête (1972-76:224 pour mille; 1977-81: 234 pour mille).<br><br>- Concernant la santé de la mère, l'enquête a montré que la grande majorité des femmes (79 pour cent) ont bénéficié d'une visite prénatale à un service sanitaire pour les naissances des cinq dernières années, mais que très peu d'accouchements (19 pour cent) se sont faits avec l'aide d'un médecin ou d'un autre personnel médical qualifié.<br><br>- L'enquête a collect6 également des données sur la couverture vaccinale au Burundi. Les deux tiers des enfants de 12-23 mois ont des carnets de santé que l'enquêtrice a vus plus de la moitié (58 pour cent) de ces enfants ayant des carnets ont été vaccinés contre toutes les maladies: BCG, Polio, DTCoq et Rougeole.<br><br>- Enfin, I'EDS a permis l'analyse des mesures anthropométriques pour les enfants de 3 à 36 mois des femmes enquêtées. Les indices étudiés sont: le poids-pour-taille, la taille-pour-âge et le poids-pour-âge. La dénutrition chronique modérée à sévère est très prévalente: presque la moitié des enfants de 3 à 36 mois sont concernés par ce type de malnutrition. Par contre, la dénutrition aigüe modérée à sévère est peu prévalente.",0047704,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Brazil - Pesquisa Nacional Sobre Saode Materno-Infantil e Planejamento Familia 1986,"A Pesquisa Nacional sobre Saude Matemo-lnfantil e Planejamento Familiar á um  estudo pioneiro, a nível nacional, que coletou informaçoes sobre o comportamento reprodutivo das mulheres em idade fértil, incluindo o planejamentn familiar. A pesquisa levantou também informações sobre os serviços de saúde materno-infantil, mortalidade, amamentação, nupcialidade, etc. <br><br>Esta Pesquisa foi relizada pela Sociedade, Civil Bem-Estar Familiar no Brao (BEMFAM), em conjunto com o Instituto para o Desenvolvimento de Reclusos (IRD), como parte do Programa de Pesquisas Demográflcas e da Saúde (DHS), e contou com o apoio técnico do Centro de Controle de Doenças (CDC), de Atlanta, EUA. A Pesquisa Nacional veio dar continuidade aos estudos anteriormente realizados pela BEMFAM em nove Estados (Pianí, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Parefba, Bahla, Santa Catarina, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul e Amazonas). O objetivo dessas Pesquisas é o de criar ume referência mais precisa, no processo de conhecimento da realidade nacional, nas áreas de satíde materno-infantil, reprodução humana e planejamento familiar. O presente estudo, realizado vinte e dois anos apos a xv Jornada Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrída, na qual foi fundada a BEMFAM e iniciou-se o movimento pelo planejamento familiar no Brasil, representa um marco para a avaliaçao e redefi- nição das atividadas, não-somente das instituições nao-governamentais, mas também daquelas desenvolvidas pelo proprio Governo. <br><br>Além disso, a Pesquisa Nacional foi enriquecida com um estudo especial realiza- do na Região Nordeste, abordando o estado nutriciounl e antropométrien das crianças menores de cinco anos de idade encontradas nos domicílios visitados. Contou-se com a colaboração e a assistência do Departamento de Nutrição do Centro de Ciencias da Saúde, da Universidade Federal de Pemambuco responsavel por este estudo. <br><br>O movimento pelo planejamento familiar no Brasil, nessas duas décadas, evoluiu de maneira segura, embora se ressentisse de certa lentidão. Isto é compreensível, uma vez que tratava-se de introduzir uma inovação sócio-cultural, nem sempre bem com- preendida inicialmente, pelos diversos setores da Sociedade. No entanto, o trabalho de informação e divulgação realizado pela BEMFAM ao longo destes anos foi, aos poucos, conseguindo formar um ambiente sócio-polItien-cnitusal inteiramente favorável ao planejamento familiar. Em consunáncia com esse ambiente, também a postura governamental evolui favoravelmente. O exemplo maior da atual posição do Governo foi o lançamento, en fins de 1984, do Programa de Assistência Integral à Saúde da Mulher (PAISM), qu contempla o planejamentu familiar no contexto das demais açoes visando a melhov da saúde da mulher, em todas as fases de sua vida. Além disso, em fevereiro de 198q através da Portaria N ° 3.660, o Ministério da Previdéncia e Assistência Social daterm nou a inclusio de atividades informativas, educativas e assistenciais de planejament familiar entre os serviços prestados à população pelo Instituto Nacional de Assistanci Madica da Previdéncia, Social (INAMPS). Logo após, medida semelhante foi tomad com relação à Legião Brasileira de Assistência (LBA). Finalmente, também o Ministerio da Educação se integrou a este esforço, determinando a incluso de ações info mativas, educativas e assistenciais em planejamentu familiar nos serviços de Saúde de unidades de ensino do 3 ° Grau, públicas ou privadas. Neste contexto, os dados levm tados e analisados na Pesquisa Nacional sobre Saúde Materno-Infantil e Planejament Familiar permitirão identificar as carências e correçtes necessarias,além de assegurar a Governo que suas iniciativas, na área do planejamento familiar, estão plenamente rel paldadas pela vontade da população. <br><br>Com estes objetivos, a Pesquisa' Nacional procurou ser representativa do total d mulheres em idade fértil (MIF) do País e, também, de suas diferentes regiões Geo-economicas, marcadas por profundas diversidades regionais. O Brasil posani, atualmentl uma população de 141 milhões de habitantes, distribuídos em cinco regioes geográficas. A Região Norte, que compreende 42% do território nacional, é a de menor popull ção (5% do total), e cuja maioria dos habitantes vive concentrada em dois centros urbi nos principais: Manaus e Belém. A Região Nordeste é a mais pobre do País, tendo um renda per capita menor que a metade da renda per capita média do Pais. Ela ocup 18% do território brasileiro e abriga 29% da população total, incluindo 44% da popt lação rural brasileira (IBGE, 1984). E uma região predominantemente agrícola, porén as secas periódicas reduziram as terras cultiváveis, fazendo aumentar os niveis de pobreza, sobretudo, no meio rural. A região mais desenvolvida do País, o Sudeste, é tan bém a de maior densidade populacional: 56 habitantes por quilometro quadrado. Est regio possui apenas 11% da área territorial do Brasil, mas comporta nada menos qu 44% da população nacional. A Região Sul compreende 7% do territorio e 15% da população total. E uma região bastante próspera, embora menos industrializada que o Sodeste. Finalmente, o Centro-Oeste, onde se localiza a capital do Pais, é a segund maior região em área territorial (22%) e a segunda de menor população: 7% do tota (1). Estas regiões se caracterizam por notáveis disparidades nas proporções entre os rei pectivos territórios, suas popuiações e seus estágios de desenvolvimento s6cio-economico. <br><br>Nos últimos trinta anos, o Brasil passou por significativas mudanças no seu con texto demográfico, iniciando-se na chamada ""transição demográfica'. Os anos 50 caracterizaram-se por uma acentuada queda da mortalidade, causada principalmente pel declínio das taxas de mortalidade infantil, declínio este observado em todo o Paíl independentemente da Região ou do local de residência -rural ou urbano. Esta qued na mortalidade infantil foi decorrente, principalmente, da introdução de novas tecnc logias na área médica e, também, de medidas voltadas para a melhoria do atendiment em saúde pública. Não decorreu, portanto, de uma possível melhoria do n:ível stci¢ econúmico da população.  De qualquer modo, houve um aumento na expectativa de vida da população, cujos ganhos mais acentuados foram observados nas regiões Sul e Sudeste. Somado ao declínio da mortalidade infantil, isto resultou em um aumento na taxa de crescimento popnlacional. Somente na segunda metade dos anos 60, a fecundidade começa a decli- nar, Este fen6meno foi observado, primeiramente, nas áreas urbanas das regiões Sul e Sudeste, generalizando.se depois em outras regiões e, também, nas áreas rurais. A par- rir daí, então, inicia-se um processo de desaceleração do crescimentu populacional, com uma relativa redução da proporção de jovens na estrutura estaria da população. <br><br>Na decada de 70, o declínio da fecundidade se torna mais r~ípido, inclusive, atin- gindo segmentus populacionais que apresentavam um padrão reprodutivo caracterizado por taxas elevadas de fecundidade. De acordo com os resultados do Censo Demográfico de 1980, a fecundidade no País declinou em 24%, durante os anos 70, passando a taxa de fecundidade total (TFT) de 5,8 filhos por mulher, em 1970, para 4,4, em 1980. <br><br>Sem dúvida, as causas desse declínio ainda não foram explicadas em profundida- de. Um aspecto, entretanto, chama a atenção: o declínio na fecundidade temse verificado na ans6ncia de qualquer programa oficial de planejamento familiar. Contudo, o que encontramos, hoje, no Brasil, é uma população feminina conhecedora dos métodos anticoncepcionais e de suas fontes de obtenção, utilizando-os principalmente aUavés da rede privada, farmácias, médicos e hospitais particulares. Somente na Região Nor- deste o setor público se mostra mais presente, em virtude dos conv6nios mantidos pe- los Governos estaduais com a BEMFAM, visando a implementação de programas de planejamento familiar. <br><br>A BEMFAM, desde a sua fundação, fundamentou o seu trabalho no desenvolvi- mento de um processo informativo e educativo em todos os níveis e, também, no apoio a Entidades prestadoras de assisténcia em sadde, para que o planejamento fami-liar fosse uma extensão e um componente dos serviços ja existentes. Ao colocar estes dados à disposição de todos os que se interessam por este importante aspecto de safide, a BEMFAM da continuidade aos seus programas de pesquisa e de informação e educa- ção, esperando contribuir, assim, para a permanente melhoria das açoes voltadas para a saúde materno-infantil.",0047620,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Bolivia - Encuesta de Productividad de Empresas (Survey of  Enterprise Productivity) 2007,"The majority of firms in many developing countries are informal. Bolivia has the highest level of informality in Latin America, according to 2007 World Bank data.

The study was designed as part of World Bank's economic and sector work (ESW) to understand the costs and benefits of formality. Researchers used GPS coordinates to measure the distance of a firm to the tax registration office, and to control for the distance to the city center and to the municipal registration office. The distance to the tax office was then used as an instrument for formalizing. <br><br>The survey covered micro- and small enterprises in four largest cities - La Paz, El Alto, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba - with additional research conducted in several rural areas. Six industries were chosen for the survey: grocery stores, restaurants and food sales, manufacturing of clothing from wool and cloth, transportation of passengers and cargo, manufacturing of clothing from camelid wool (from llamas and alpacas), and manufacturing of furniture from wood.

Benin - Plans Fonciers Ruraux Impact Evaluation 2011,"Throughout rural Sub-Saharan Africa, the allocation and enforcement of land rights involve a diverse and complex set of customary arrangements made and upheld by local stakeholders such as village chiefs, councils of elders, and land chiefs. Customary land tenure systems often coexist with formal land administration systems, where proof of ownership or of use rights is documented with registered titles or deeds. Yet only a small proportion of the population holds formal land titles for the land they de facto own. This lack of formal land rights may lead to under-investment and sub-optimal yields. Codification of private property rights within an effective legal framework should in theory increase agricultural investment and productivity, and spur economic development. Hence, the policy response to undocumented property rights has often been the “formalization” of land tenure (i.e., the incorporation of “informal”, customary, undocumented tenure claims into the formal system of property rights), often through the provision of freehold titles.<br><br>While land titling programs have met with relative success in rural and urban settings, the evidence from Africa is less positive. This contrast is perhaps due to oversimplified interventions that neglect the complexity of customary land relations in rural areas, the limited capacity of central land administrations for the delivery of titles, or the difficulties in establishing decentralized institutions. The distributional impacts of land formalization programs are also ambiguous: Despite some claims of the possibly deleterious effects of individualizing land rights for women, there is scant rigorous evidence from impact evaluations to support or refute these claims.<br><br>Benin is one of the countries in West Africa where the design and implementation of policies to consolidate land rights is furthest advanced. The Plan Foncier Rural (PFR), first tried in Côte d'Ivoire in 1989 and piloted in Benin since 1993, is a key policy experiment in this respect. The program is currently in the initial stages of a planned implementation scale-up in Benin. The objectives of the program are to improve tenure security and stimulate agricultural investment in rural areas through the registration of land rights.<br><br>The Plan Fonciers Ruraux Impact Evaluation presents early evidence from the first large-scale randomized-controlled trial of a land formalization policy. The study was designed to address the following questions and issues:<br>- What is the effect of the PFR on perceived and de facto tenure security?<br>- What is the effect of the PFR on land market participation and land prices?<br>- What is the effect of the PFR on investment in land and agricultural production and yields?<br>- Additional issues: off-farm activities and gender differentiated impacts<br><br>The study examines the links between land demarcation and investment in rural Benin in light of a model of agricultural production under insecure tenure. The demarcation process involved communities in the mapping and attribution of land rights; cornerstones marked parcel boundaries and offered lasting landmarks. Consistent with the model, improved tenure security under demarcation induces a shift toward long-term investment on treated parcels. This investment does not yet coincide with gains in agricultural productivity. The analysis also identifies significant gender specific effects. Female-managed landholdings in treated villages are more likely to be left fallow—an important soil fertility investment. Women further respond to an exogenous tenure security change by moving production away from relatively secure, demarcated land and toward less secure land outside the village to guard those parcels.",0047516,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Bangladesh - Improving Indoor Air Quality for Poor Families: Controlled Experiments 2005-2006,"Indoor air pollution (IAP) is dangerously high for many poor families in Bangladesh. Concentrations of 300 ug/m3 for respirable airborne particulates (PM10) or greater are common in Bangladeshi households, implying widespread exposure to a serious health hazard.<br><br>To promote a better understanding of IAP, in 2003, the World Bank’s research department has investigated the IAP in Bangladesh using the latest air monitoring technology and a national household survey (IAP Research, Phase I). The analysis of determinants of IAP verifies the IAP reducing potential of clean fuels (kerosene, natural gas, etc.), but the nationwide survey results revealed: Poor households in Bangladesh (like in other parts of Asia and Latin America) almost always use “dirty” biomass fuels, because in most rural areas, clean fuels are not available at all. Even where a clean fuel is available, poor households prefer and use “dirty” fuels because the relative price of the “clean” fuel is simply too high. Improved stoves for biomass combustion could help but, as other studies in Asia and Latin America have also discovered, the World Bank survey found almost no adoption of improved stoves despite widespread promotional efforts in Bangladesh. Households report non-adoption for a variety of reasons, including capital and maintenance costs, inconvenience, and incompatibility with food preparation traditions. Thus, neither clean fuels nor improved stoves offer strong prospects for reducing IAP in the rural area in near future.<br><br>Fortunately, the World Bank study has identified another option that looks much more promising. In Bangladesh, common variations in certain household characteristics -- construction materials, space configurations, cooking locations and use of doors and windows -- have produced large differences in IAP exposure. As a result, some poor households using “dirty” fuels enjoy indoor air quality normally associated with clean fuels, while others suffer from pollution levels ten times the international safe standard. Since many poor households already have some of the relevant characteristics, they are clearly acceptable and affordable in Bangladesh. The IAP-Phase I research, therefore, has tentatively concluded that a national “clean household” promotion program, combined with effective public education on the associated health benefits, could reduce IAP exposure to much safer levels for many poor families.<br><br>Although the general results are quite robust, the first-round research has only been able to consider a subset of feasible measures that might yield significant benefits in this context. Before proposing a national “clean household” program to policy makers, one needs to establish a broader and more rigorously-confirmed set of clean characteristics as well as to assess their cost effectiveness in different regions of Bangladesh. Current research in Bangladesh has conducted a program of direct, controlled experimentation and cost-effectiveness analysis that will provide the needed evidence. The experimentation of the research is confined to structural arrangements(building materials, cooking locations, window/ door configurations etc.) that are already common among poor households in Bangladesh.<br><br>The World Bank study has used two types of equipment: real-time monitors that record PM10 at 2-minute intervals, and air samplers that measure 24-hour average PM10 concentrations.<br><br>1. The real-time monitoring instrument is the Thermo Electric Personal DataRAM (pDR-1000). The pDR-1000 uses a light scattering photometer (nephelometer) to measure airborne particle concentrations. The operative principle is real-time measurement of light scattered by aerosols, integrated over as wide a range of angles as possible. At each location, the instrument operated continuously, without intervention, for a 24-hour period to record PM10 concentrations at 2-minute intervals. <br><br>2. The other instrument used in the study is the Airmetrics MiniVol Portable Air Sampler (Airmetrics, 2004), a more conventional device that samples ambient air for 24 hours. While the MiniVol is not a reference method sampler, it gives results that closely approximate data from U.S. Federal Reference Method samplers. The MiniVols were programmed to draw air at 5 liters/minute through PM10 particle size separators (impactors) and then through filters. The particles were caught on the filters, and the filters were weighed pre- and post exposure with a microbalance.",0047457,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Bangladesh - Post-Distribution Monitoring Cash-Based Interventions - July 2018,"The Rohingya refugee population living in settlements in Cox’s Bazar is dependent on international assistance. Presently, there are limits on how self-sufficient refugees can be, as they have restricted freedom of movement beyond the areas where the settlements are and also have no right to work. In addition, there is insufficient land within their settlements to support subsistence farming. As a result, many refugees are unable to access cash independently to support themselves, and many struggle for the basic necessities not already covered by humanitarian assistance. All current assistance in the form of in-kind distributions and services are free of charge. This includes, for example, food, shelter materials, household items and health services. A number of cash-for-work schemes were designed to support and manage some of the basic services and works in the camps; however, to date, they have not created sufficient income opportunities for refugees or host communities. Likewise, our teams have confirmed that some humanitarian aid items are being sold at local markets. This shows refugees are adopting other, and potentially harmful, coping mechanisms to generate cash for their needs that are not, or not fully, covered by current humanitarian assistance. Negative coping strategies such as food borrowing, reduction in the number of meals and reduced consumption of preferred foods are witnessed across the entire Rohingya refugee population. Between April and May 2018, UNHCR piloted the delivery of unconditional and unrestricted Multipurpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to cover unmet basic needs. This extended to all residents of Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement and was equivalent to approximately half of the monthly Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for a family of five.<br><br>After completing the delivery of the grants, UNHCR conducted a detailed Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey (320 households were interviewed). A Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey is a mechanism to collect and understand refugees’ feedback on the assistance provided by humanitarian agencies like UNHCR. PDMs are widely used by UNHCR and help to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance provided directly by UNHCR or through its partners. A PDM is conducted independently from the distribution exercise itself, but closely following it in time. This PDM was intended to evaluate the adequacy of the cash grant provided as well as patterns in its use. It also sought to identify challenges and constraints experienced, and seek refugees’ feedback on any improvements required to implement similar assistance again in the future.<br><br>The PDM supports a hypothesis that the current basic in-kind assistance packages provided to refugees are not sufficient to meet all demonstrated needs, with the result that potentially harmful coping mechanisms like selling assistance are employed. The adoption of this cash programme by UNHCR, therefore, seeks to ensure that refugees can address their multiple needs in accordance with their household and personal priorities, including benefits such as greater access to a more diversified diet, better hygiene or shelter improvements.",0047420,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Bangladesh - Post Distribution Monitoring shelter and non-food items - September 2018,"Since 25 August 2017, human rights violations and targeted violence against the Rohingya community in Rakhine State, Myanmar, have forced over 728,0002 of them to seek sanctuary in Bangladesh. Half of the refugees (55%) are children. Within two months of the first arrivals, the number of refugee population in Cox’s Bazar district quadrupled, which made it the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. The refugees continued to arrive by foot and boat in subsequent months. Most of them came with few belongings or cash. UNHCR was among the first humanitarian organisations to respond to the refugee influx with life-saving assistance. Packages of blankets, plastic sheets, sleeping mats, family tents, plastic rolls, kitchen sets, jerry cans and buckets were distributed initially to 250,000 refugees within weeks after their arrival. By end of August 2018, UNHCR distributed 93,803 Core Relief Item (CRI) packages to newly arrived refugee families, each containing tarpaulins, kitchen set, blanket, jerry can, bucket, sleeping mat and solar lamp. At the same time, 90,524 families received Upgrade Shelter Kit (USK) consisting of mulli and borak bamboos, rope, plastic tarpaulins, sandbags and toolkits, to reinforce their shelters for the monsoon season. UNHCR, in close collaboration with partner agencies and other humanitarian actors, continues to support the Government of Bangladesh in responding to the refugee crisis by ensuring relief items are prepositioned and delivered to the most vulnerable refugees and host communities in a timely manner.<br><br>UNHCR uses Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugee’s feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilisation and effectiveness of assistance received. It is conducted after the distribution of relief items is completed. A total of 2,298 households were interviewed in this PDM. The PDM survey confirmed that non-food packages distributed by UNHCR and partners met the household needs and minimum quality standard as agreed by the Shelter/NFI Sector in Cox’s Bazar. The overall satisfaction score has improved from the previous survey in March. The refugees reported high satisfaction for the items received, and rated above 4.1 on a 5-point Likert scale for the items quality and usefulness. They also reported general satisfaction with the organisation of NFI distribution, with an average score of 4.0 on the Likert scale. The finding shows that UNHCR and partners are fulfilling their commitment to provide relief items that meet the specific needs of refugees, and that they were distributed in a timely and efficient manner.",0047419,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
"Bangladesh - Multi Sector Needs Assessment: Cox’s Bazar, Rohingya Refugee Response – July 2018","An estimated 723,000 Rohingya refugees have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 25, 2017. Most of the newly-arrived refugees rely on humanitarian assistance, having left with few possessions and exhausted their financial resources during the journey. The monsoon season began in May and continues into September, threatening the vast majority of refugees living in makeshift shelters and settlements highly vulnerable to floods and landsides. To understand the priority needs of the refugees, a Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA), commissioned by UNHCR and with technical support from REACH, was conducted at the household level in 31 refugee sites (3,171 households were surveyed). Translators Without Borders supported in questionnaire translation and enumerator training.  This survey identified a number of areas where the basic needs of Rohingya refugees are being met.  At the same time, this assessment has identified continuing service gaps in the Rohingya response.  For example, the majority of households do not believe there is enough light at night to safely access latrines, and WASH facilities are generally perceived as dangerous areas for girls under age 18. In terms of access to protection services, only a small number of households report members making use of children and women friendly spaces. Despite widespread distribution coverage of key non-food items such as kitchen sets, demand for these items remains high, and refugees are spending the greatest portion of their limited financial resources on basic items including food, clothing and fuel. Findings suggest that there are uncertainties around actions to prepare for cyclones. The mahjis remain almost the sole focal point for communication and complaints with refugees, reflecting their continued prominent position within refugee communities. Finally, the median household debt is twice the median household income for the 30 days prior to data collection, with only two-fifths of households reporting any source of income at all.",0047418,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

The survey was conducted in November - December 1996, on the whole territory of the republic by the State Department of Statistics (SDS) of ROA with technical and financial assistance from the World Bank.<br><br>The data collected included information on household composition, housing conditions, education level of household members, employment and income, savings, borrowing, as well as details on levels of expenditure including those on food, non-food, health, tourism and business. The survey covered about 100 villages and 28 towns. The size of the sample was 5,040 households of which 4,920 responded which makes the survey the largest carried out in Armenia to date and one with a very high response rate for a transition economy. The expenditure part of the data was collected using two different methods administered for different households. The methods are: recall method in which households were asked, during the interview, about their expenditures made during the last 30 days preceding the date of the interview; and a diary method where households were given a diary they used to record details about their income and expenditure on a daily basis for 30 days during the interview period. About 25% of the total sample of interviewed households used diaries and 75% used the recall method. The unit of study in the survey was the household, defined as a group of co-resident individuals with a common living budget. As will be explained in detail, the AHBS 96 was generally designed as a two stage stratified sampling, but for large urban areas with an almost definite probability of being selected, a one stage sampling was adopted.<br><br>The Armenian HBS 1996 is not a standard Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) survey - the questionnaire used is more limited in scope and much different in format from a typical LSMS.

World - Estimates of Distortions to Agricultural Incentives 1955-2011,"The World Bank’s research project on “Distortions to Agricultural Incentives” has produced a core database of Nominal Rates of Assistance to producers, or NRAs, together with a set of Consumer Tax Equivalents, or CTEs, for farm products and a set of Relative Rates of Assistance to farmers in 75 focus countries. This is a detailed core database. <br><br><br><br>The vast majority of the world’s poorest households depend on farming for their livelihood. In the past their earnings were often depressed by pro-urban and anti-agricultural biases of their own country’s policies. While progress has been made over the past two decades by numerous developing countries in reducing those policy biases, many trade-reducing price distortions remain intersectorally as well as within the agricultural sector of low-, middle- and high-income countries.<br><br><br><br>This project, in seeking to understand the extent, effects of and reasons behind that transformation, began by compiling new estimates of price distortions over the past half century. National country studies were undertaken in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe’s transition economies. They were supplemented with similar estimates and analytical narratives of policy trends in 20 high-income countries. Together those countries account for more than 90 percent of the value of global agricultural output. <br><br><br><br>The core database provides nominal rates of assistance estimates for the main individual commodities that together account for about 70 percent of the value of farm production in those countries, as well as guesstimates of the NRA for the 30 percent of farm production not covered. Also estimated is the NRA for non-agricultural tradables so as to compute a relative rate of assistance. Consumer tax equivalents are also provided for the covered products in each focus country, along with value of production and consumption at undistorted prices and of trade for each covered product and for non-covered farm products. The working paper no. 4612, available as external resources, serves as the ""methodology paper"" for this first database.",0047308,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Albania - Demographic and Health Survey 2008-2009,"In the early-mid 1990s, Albania entered a new phase of major changes, moving from a totalitarian to a democratic system and shifting gradually to the free market economy. This process led, naturally, to changes in various demographic and health characteristics of the Albanian society.<br><br>The 2008-09 Albania Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS) is a nationally representative study aimed at collecting and providing information on population, demographic, and health characteristics of the country. Population-based studies of this magnitude are a major undertaking that provide information on important indicators which measure the progress of a country. <br><br>The ADHS results help provide the necessary information to assess, measure, and evaluate the existing programs in the country. They also provide crucial information to policy-makers when drafting new policies and strategies related to the health sector and health services in Albania. <br><br>The information collected in the 2008-09 Albania Demographic and Health Survey will be used not only by local decision-makers and programme managers, but also by partners and foreign donors involved in various development areas in Albania, as well as by academic institutions to do further analysis with the collected data.<br><br>The 2008-09 Albania Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS) was implemented by the Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) and the Institute of Public Health (IPH), of the Ministry of Health. ICF Macro provided technical assistance to the ADHS through funding from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United State Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded MEASURE DHS programme. Local costs of the survey were supported by USAID, the Swiss Cooperation Office in Albania (SCO-A), UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br>Data collection was conducted from 28 October, 2008 to 26 April, 2009 using a nationally representative sample of almost 9,000 households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men age 15-49 in half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed. In addition to the data collected through interviews with these women and men, capillary blood samples were collected from all children age 6-59 months and all eligible women and men age 15-49 for anaemia testing. All children under five years of age and eligible women and men age 15-49 were weighed and measured to assess their nutritional status. Finally, blood pressure (BP) was measured for eligible women and men in the households selected for the men’s interview to estimate the prevalence of hypertension in the adult population.<br><br>The 2008-09 ADHS is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Albania. Specifically, the 2008-09 ADHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, knowledge and use of family planning methods, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women and young children, childhood mortality, maternal and child health, and awareness and behaviour regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Additional features of the 2008-09 ADHS include the collection of information on migration (out-migration, returning migrants and internal migration), haemoglobin testing to detect the presence of anaemia, blood pressure (BP) measurements among the adult population, and questions related to accessibility and affordability of health services. The information collected in the 2008-09 ADHS provides updated estimates of an array of demographic and health indicators that will assist in the development of appropriate policies and programmes to address the most important health issues in Albania.",0043606,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

Women 50-59 years old were interviewed with an abbreviated questionnaire that only covered background characteristics and questions related to noncommunicable diseases.<br><br>The primary objective of the 2017-2018 ADHS was to provide estimates of basic sociodemographic and health indicators for the country as a whole and the twelve prefectures. Specifically, the survey collected information on basic characteristics of the respondents, fertility, family planning, nutrition, maternal and child health, knowledge of HIV behaviors, health-related lifestyle, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The information collected in the ADHS will assist policymakers and program managers in evaluating and designing programs and in developing strategies for improving the health of the country’s population.<br><br>The sample for the 2017-18 ADHS was designed to produce representative results for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas separately, and for each of the twelve prefectures known as Berat, Diber, Durres, Elbasan, Fier, Gjirokaster, Korce, Kukes, Lezhe, Shkoder, Tirana, and Vlore.",0043597,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"
Predicting Food Crises 2020,"Globally, more than 130 million people are estimated to be in food crisis. These humanitarian disasters are associated with severe impacts on livelihoods that can reverse years of development gains. The existing outlooks of crisis-affected populations rely on expert assessment of evidence and are limited in their temporal frequency and ability to look beyond several months. This paper presents a statistical foresting approach to predict the outbreak of food crises with sufficient lead time for preventive action. Different use cases are explored related to possible alternative targeting policies and the levels at which finance is typically<br>unlocked. The results indicate that, particularly at longer forecasting horizons, the statistical predictions compare favorably to expert-based outlooks. The paper concludes that statistical models demonstrate good ability to detect future outbreaks of food crises and that using statistical forecasting approaches may help increase lead time for action.",0043593,,"[{""name"": ""Visit the Microdata Library to access data and documentation."", ""description"": null, ""url"": null}]"

 Global Distribution of Economic Activity,"<p>Data for replicating The Global Spatial Distribution of Economic Activity: Nature, History, and the Role of Trade (forthcoming 2018; with Vernon Henderson, Tim Squires and David N. Weil) Quarterly Journal of Economics</p>
<p>We explore the role of natural characteristics in determining the worldwide spatial distribution of economic activity, as proxied by lights at night, observed across 240,000 grid cells. A parsimonious set of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47% of worldwide variation and 35% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers.  We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries.  For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.</p>

Estimates of Distortions to Agricultural Incentives,"<p>The World Bank research project on ""Distortions to Agricultural Incentives"" has produced a core database of Nominal Rates of Assistance to producers, or NRAs, together with a set of Consumer Tax Equivalents, or CTEs, for farm products and a set of Relative Rates of Assistance to farmers in 75 focus countries. The core database provides nominal rates of assistance estimates for the main individual commodities that together account for about 70 percent of the value of farm production in those countries, as well as guesstimates of the NRA for the 30 percent of farm production not covered. Also estimated is the NRA for non-agricultural tradables so as to compute a relative rate of assistance. Consumer tax equivalents are also provided for the covered products in each focus country, along with value of production and consumption at undistorted prices and of trade for each covered product and for non-covered farm products. The supplementary database on trade and welfare reduction indexes provides estimates of welfare and trade reduction indexes for each of the 75 countries.</p>

This paper addresses the practical methodological issues that need to be faced when attempting to undertake such a measurement task in developing countries. The approach is illustrated in two ways: by presenting estimates of nominal and relative rates of assistance to farmers in China for the period 1981 to 2005; and by summarizing estimates from an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model of the effects on agricultural versus non-agricultural markets of the project's measured distortions globally as of 2004.

This is especially the case when some countries tax and others subsidize its production or consumption. This article develops a new set of more-satisfactory indicators for that purpose, drawing on the recent literature on trade restrictiveness indexes. It then exploits a global agricultural distortions database recently compiled by the World Bank to generate the first set of estimates of those two indicators for each of 28 key agricultural commodities from 1960 to 2004, based on a sample of 75 countries that together account for more than three-quarters of the world's production of those agricultural commodities.

WPS 8825 - Trading off the Income Gains and the Inequality Costs of Trade Policy,"<p>This paper characterizes the trade-off between the income gains and the inequality costs of trade using survey data for 54 developing countries. Tariff data on agricultural and manufacturing goods are combined with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate the first-order effects of the elimination of import tariffs on household welfare. The paper assesses how these welfare effects vary across the distribution by estimating impacts on the consumption of traded goods, wage income, farm and non-farm family enterprise income, and government transfers. For each country, the income gains and the inequality costs of trade liberalization are quantified and the trade-offs between them are assessed using an Atkinson social welfare index. The analysis finds average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in nine countries. Across countries in the sample, the gains from trade are 1.9 percent of real household expenditure on average. We find overwhelming evidence of a trade-off between the income gains (losses) and the inequality costs (gains), which arise because trade tends to exacerbate income inequality: 45 countries face a trade-off, while only nine do not. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality. In the majority of developing countries, the prevailing tariff structure thus induces sizable welfare losses</p>

Crowdsourced Price Data Collection Pilot,"<p>Crowdsourced price data from 15 pilot countries, namely, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela and Vietnam; from December 2015 to August 2016 and covering 162 household good and service items.</p>
<p>This database is a repository of information collected during a World Bank pilot study on the feasibility of crowdsourced price data collection utilizing modern information and communication technologies. The collected data can be used for a variety of spatial and temporal price studies and other price-related applications.</p>
<p>The data was collected by leveraging a privately-operated network of paid on-the-ground contributors that had access to a smartphone application. Price collection tasks and related guidance was pushed through the application to specific geographical locations. The contributors carried out the requested collection tasks and submitted price data and other metadata using the application.</p>
<p>The pilot was conducted in 15 pilot countries, namely, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela and Vietnam from December 2015 to August 2016. The collected price data covers 162 tightly specified household good and service items, including food and non-alcoholic beverages; alcoholic beverages and tobacco; clothing and footwear; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance; health; transport; communication; recreation and culture; education; restaurants and hotels; and miscellaneous goods and services.</p>
<p>In total, the database includes 1,262,458 price observations, ranging from 196,188 observations for Brazil to 14,102 observations for Cambodia. The observations are accompanied by a rich set of metadata, including longitude and latitude coordinates and related geographical designations, time-stamps, outlet identifiers, volume and weight details, and brand and model information. Due to the pilot nature of this data, the survey coverage varies between and within countries. In addition, the comparability of price data for goods is typically more reliable than those for services.</p>

Indicators of Access to and Use of Financial Services Across Countries,"<p>This project seeks to develop indicators of access to and use of financial services across countries (what we broadly refer to as ""outreach'), as well as to study what explains variations in access, and how such differences affect economic outcomes across countries. For this purpose, we developed two original questionnaires. The first one targets bank regulators in over 100 countries and inquires primarily about the number of bank outlets (branches and ATMs), and the volume and value of loans and deposits in each country. The second questionnaire surveys the 5 largest banks in over 70 countries about the factors that explains their choice of location, the pricing and terms of their products, and who is granted access to them.</p>
<p>At this point, we have completed the collection of data from regulators and have produced a working paper that presents the outreach indicators we developed and analyzes both their determinants and their impact on firm financing constraints. The collection of bank level data is still on-going. So far we have received responses from 169 banks in 71 countries.</p>

Market Access: Kyrgyz Republic,"<p>Exploiting the theory of a classic gravity model, the Market Accessibility index is a measure of potential economic connectivity between village/towns and big cities.

Using the transportation network and estimated travel time is a more realistic measure of<br />
economic distance than Euclidean distance because not all distances are equal in travel time and physical or man-made barriers may provide routes that are not straight line distance. Since various methodologies exist for the discount of the market size, a robustness test is suggested.</p>

Urban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in a Changing Climate - Building Local Resilience to Disaster Risk,"<p>This dataset provides five flood scenarios for Greater Dhaka Area, with estimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation, for extreme rainfall event in 2050.</p>
<p>Intense rainfall floods Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the world’s fastest-growing megacities, year in and year out. Low-lying flood plains, rivers, and canals that once drained water are gradually filling up as a result of indiscriminate urbanization, and now magnify, rather than help solve the problem. The climatic outlook for South Asia in the 21st century signals heavier and more erratic rainfall during the monsoon season, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization.  Thus, climate change may further aggravate Dhaka’s flood vulnerability.</p>
<p>Dhaka needs to better manage its flood drainage infrastructure and strengthen the city’s climate-disaster resilience and adaptive capacity.  But climate-smart policies require local planners to better understand the likely damage from current flooding, potential damage from climate-related risks, measures that can be taken to cope with current and future flooding as well as adaptation costs.</p>
<p>In an effort to enhance such understanding and to provide input to development of adaptation policies, this research estimated location-specific depth and duration of inundation from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change, discussed structural adaptation measures to cope with current and future flooding, evaluated the reduction in inundation resulting from implementing these measures, and estimated adaptation cost.</p>
<p>Depth and duration of inundation in Greater Dhaka Area from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change under different scenarios at ward/ thana-level have been summarized in the Excel Workbook “Urban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in 2050”</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Study Area:</strong><br />
The dataset covers Greater Dhaka Area: Eastern Dhaka, Western Dhaka-Goranchatbari, Western Dhaka-Kallyanpur, Central Dhaka, Old Dhaka, DND and Narayanganj.</p>
<p>As flooding is a periodic problem in Dhaka, the city can be said to already have an <em>adaptation deficit even without climate change</em>. The analysis therefore addressed the issue from both current and future climate perspectives.</p>
<p>**Future (2050) Rainfall Extreme Scenarios: **</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dhaka experienced 341mm rainfall in 24 hours in September 2004; and this historic extreme rainfall was taken as the current climate baseline in the underlying analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the future, the underlying analysis considered a 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall in a changing climate by 2050.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions about the Future:</strong><br />
As any change in land use has implications for the percentage of built-up area, and therefore drainage of the storm water, the analysis assumed that future land cover would change according to the RAJUK’s Detailed Action Plan (DAP). For drainage, the analysis assumed that all improvements to Dhaka’s drainage infrastructure, both planned and proposed by the relevant drainage-system authority, would be implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Five Alternative Scenarios:</strong><br />
Estimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation were estimated for extreme rainfall event in 2050 for following five scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario1:  341mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>As timing and magnitude of climate change is somewhat unknown, ward/thana-level inundation depth and duration for 2050 were generated for the baseline rainfall event without consideration of any climate change. The analysis accounts for expected socioeconomic changes and planned changes in the land use pattern as well as drainage infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 2: 341mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimates of inundation from scenario1 were discussed with the local experts and based on their recommendations a set of potential adaptation measures - for example increase in pump capacity, sludge cleaning, laying of new drainage pipes, deepening existing water bodies - was designed and incorporated in hydrological modeling. The modeling was repeated with different capacities of pumps etc. until a desirable depth and duration of inundation for each study region was attained.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 3: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Ward/thana-level estimates of inundation depth and duration were generated for the changing climate in 2050 taking into account climate change - using a potential 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall as a factor as well as accounting for expected socioeconomic changes, planned changes in the land use pattern and drainage infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 4: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications for flooding were estimated in a changing climate after current climate adaptation deficit is met.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 5: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit and with adaptation for climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications for a set of adaptation measures suggested by local experts to deal with climate change were estimated.</p>
<p>These estimates are from the three-step hydrological modeling component of the study.  The first modeling step simulated basin-level flows from the Brahmaputra River in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River system since they strongly influence monsoon-season river flows and water levels in the Greater Dhaka area.  In the second step, the effects of climate change on the regional rivers were simulated.  Finally, in the third step, detailed modeling of the drainage system in and around Dhaka city was simulated. The analysis centered on the worst-case scenario in which river levels are high and all sluice gates are closed. Therefore, there is no gravity drainage out of the city and the drainage system depends primarily on the performance efficiency of drainage pumps, which is often the case during intense rainfall.  For Western Dhaka-Old Dhaka, Central Dhaka, Kallyanpur, and Goranchatbari—the impacts of climate change on river flooding were not considered in the analyses as this main part of the city is protected by flood embankments on all sides.</p>

Has Climate Change Driven Urbanization In Africa?,"<p>Replication data for Henderson, J. Vernon, Adam Storeygard, and Uwe Deichmann. ""Has climate change driven urbanization in Africa?."" Journal of Development Economics 124 (2017): 60-82.<br />
Data include climate variables, conflict events, industry by district, urban/rural population, and distance to coast.</p>
<p>This paper documents a substantial impact of climate variation on urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. In a panel of over 350 subnational regions, we find that drier conditions increase urbanization in places most likely to have an urban industrial base. Total city income in such places also increases. When receiving cities have a traded good sector that is not wholly dependent upon local agriculture, migration to cities provides an “escape” from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in most places (75% of our sample) without an industrial base, there is no escape into alternative export-based employment. Drying causes reduced urban and rural incomes, with little overall impact on the urban population share. Finally, the paper shows that climate variation also induces employment changes within the rural sector itself. Drier conditions induce a shift out of farm activities, especially for women, into non-farm activities, and especially out of the measured work force. Overall, these findings imply a strong link between climate and urbanization in Africa.</p>

What Improves Environmental Performance? Evidence from Mexican Industry,"<p>Survey data from Mexico, 1995, which provides detailed information on environmental performance and determinants, including plant, firm and market characteristics, pollution control costs, relationships with regulators, and measures to improve environmental performance. All plant and respondent identities were kept confidential.  The data and survey document are all contained in the zip file.</p>
<p>As preparation for their research paper on ""What Improves Environmental Performance? Evidence from Mexican Industry,"" Susmita Dasgupta, Mala Hettige and David Wheeler used survey evidence to analyze the effects of regulation, plant-level management policies, and plant and firm characteristics on environmental performance in Mexican factories. They focused especially on management policies: the degree of effort to improve environmental performance and the type of management strategy adopted.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted in the fall of 1995, focused on the food, chemicals, non-metallic minerals and metals sectors, which account for 75 percent to 95 percent of Mexico’s total industrial pollution. 236 facilities in the survey were chosen as representative of Mexican factories as defined by sector, size and location.</p>
<p>The survey was designed by a World Bank team, conducted by the Monterrey Institute of Technology, and supported by the Mexico National Environment Ministry (SEMARNAP) and the Mexican National Association of Industries. The survey provides detailed information on performance and determinants, including plant, firm and market characteristics, pollution control costs, relationships with regulators, and measures to improve environmental performance. All plant and respondent identities were kept confidential.</p>
<p>It is important to note the information derived from the survey was self-reported. No independently audited data on pollution and regulatory compliance was associated with the survey.</p>
<p>Finally, with confidentiality assured, 49 percent of survey respondents admitted non-compliance with regulations. With no benchmarks, only educated guesses can be made about the degree of upward bias. Evidence from Indonesia, a country with similar regulations but weaker monitoring and enforcement, revealed a non-compliance rate of 64 percent. This suggests that the degree of upward bias in the Mexican self-assessment may be small. In any case, our analysis for this research focuses on relative, not absolute, performance.</p>

World Integrated Trade Solution UNCTAD TRAINS,"<p>UNCTAD-TRAINS (Trade Analysis and Information System) is a trade and market access information system combining the database containing data drawn from UN TARMAC, a joint primary data collection with the International Trade Centre, UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), and the WITS software. TRAINS is both a data depository and an analytical tool designed for policy-makers and economic operators engaged in international merchandise trade. It is also a powerful tool for multilateral or bilateral trade negotiations as well as for general research on international merchandise trade.</p>
<p>TRAINS contains HS-based data for over 1,000 country/years, covering tariff and non-tariff measures as well as imports flows by origin for more than 160 countries and the years since 1988. For tariffs, TRAINS contains not only general applied tariff data but also information on applied preferential tariff including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and many regional and bilateral preferences.</p>
<p>TRAINS gives users the possibility of converting the HS data into other internationally recognized nomenclatures such as the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) or the Broad Economic Categories (BEC) etc... It also provides a single market, partial equilibrium trade simulation model (SMART model) with which users may simulate trade, revenue and welfare effects of tariff changes by a single market country.</p>
<p>The TRAINS database is physically located at the World Bank server where WITS application is running, but is directly maintained by UNCTAD.

Quantifying Environmental Performance Survey Results,"<p>For this exercise, we have randomly selected 31 United Nations Conference on Environmental and Development (UNCED) reports from the total of 145. These 31 range from highly industrialized to extremely poor, they are drawn from every world region, and they range in size and diversity from China to Jamaica.</p>
<p>Our survey considers the state of policy and performance in four environmental dimensions: Air, Water, Land and Living Resources. We analyze the apparent state of policy as it affects the interactions between these four environmental dimensions and five activity categories: Agriculture, Industry, Energy, Transport and the Urban Sector. Although many overlaps undoubtedly exist, we attempt to draw a separate assessment for the interaction of each activity category with each environmental dimension.</p>
<p>Our survey assessment uses twenty five questions to categorize the state of (i) environmental awareness; (ii) scope of policies adopted; (iii) scope of legislation enacted; (iv) control mechanisms in place; and (v) the degree of success in implementation. The status in each category is graded ""High, Medium, Low,"" with assigned values of 2, 1 and 0 respectively. For each UNCED country report, all twenty-five questions are answered for each element of the matrix in Table 1. With 20 elements in the matrix, 500 assessment scores are developed for each country.</p>

Overall Trade Restrictiveness Indices and Import Demand Elasticities,"<p>The Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (OTRI) summarizes the trade policy stance of a country by calculating the uniform tariff that will keep its overall imports at the current level when the country in fact has different tariffs for different goods. In a nutshell, the OTRI is a more sophisticated way to calculate the weighted average tariff of a given country, with the weights reflect the composition of import volume and import demand elasticities of each imported product. The empirical methodology of the OTRI was first developed in Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009), based on the theoretical underpinning of Anderson and Neary (1994, 1996, 2003). Irwin (forthcoming) also uses a similar methodology to study the historic protection level of the US, from 1867 to 1961. Recently, Kee, Neagu and Nicita (forthcoming) applied a fixed weight version of OTRI to study protectionism of a wide range of countries during the crisis period.</p>
<p>The OTRI and some other related indices, such as the Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Market Access Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (MAOTRI) are computed annually when new trade flows and tariff data are available. These indices feed into the Global Monitoring Report, an annual World Bank publication joint with the International Monetary Fund. The latest indices and the underlying trade data and elasticity estimates can be download from below. Please cite Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009) if you are using the elasticity estimates, the OTRI, TRI, MAOTRI or the Ad-Valorem Equivalent of Non-tariff measures of any given country.</p>

Agricultural Capital Revisited ,"<p>We construct the fixed-capital series based on national account investment data, using a modification of the perpetual inventory method. The method requires integration of the investment data to obtain capital stocks. For livestock the initial data are the number of animals. We need only calculate the values of the individual herds and then aggregate these values to obtain the total for the full stock of animals. For tree stock we use the estimated resent value of future income derived from the area planted in orchards. Three components of agricultural capital are presented for 30 countries for 1967 to 2000: fixed capital in agriculture, livestock capital, and  tree-stock capital.</p>

Unfortunately, cross-country data sets on agricultural fixed capital are rare. Using a common methodology that allows comparisons across countries, as well as over time, this paper introduces a data series on fixed capital in agriculture, based on national accounts data. The fixed capital measure differs remarkably from the Food and Agriculture Organization's data series on tractors, which has been widely utilized as a proxy for agricultural fixed capital. The authors construct comparable measures of capital in livestock and tree stock. They examine the evolution of the capital stocks from 1970 to 2000, paying particular attention to the changing composition of agricultural capital, as well as differences in the accumulation of capital for high-income and middle and lower-income countries. Using the capital measures in agricultural productivity analyses, the data yield estimated input elasticities substantially different from those found previously in the literature.

Services in the trans-pacific partnership : what would be lost?,"<p>As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape future negotiations. The TPPs services component has been hailed as one of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore, new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.</p>

Viet Nam - Food Insecurity Experience Scale 2014,"Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 2.1 commits countries to end hunger, ensure access by all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year around. Indicator 2.1.2, ""Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)"", provides internationally-comparable estimates of the proportion of the population facing difficulties in accessing food. More detailed background information is available at http://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/fies/en/ .<br><br>The FIES-based indicators are compiled using the FIES survey module, containing 8 questions. Two indicators can be computed:  1. The proportion of the population experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity (SDG indicator 2.1.2), 2. The proportion of the population experiencing severe food insecurity. These data were collected by FAO through the Gallup World Poll. General information on the methodology can be found here: https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx. National institutions can also collect FIES data by including the FIES survey module in nationally representative surveys.<br><br>Microdata can be used to calculate the indicator 2.1.2 at national level. Instructions for computing this indicator are described in the methodological document available under the ""DOCUMENTATION"" tab above. Disaggregating results at sub-national level is not encouraged because estimates will suffer from substantial sampling and measurement error.",0024249,,[]
